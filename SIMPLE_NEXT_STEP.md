## 🎯 YOUR ONE GOAL (Choose ONE)

### Option A: **Just Check Your Status** (2 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/memphis/.cursor/worktrees/SovereignShadow_II/2J1t5
python3 scripts/get_real_balances.py
```
**That's it.** See what you have. No decisions needed.

---

### Option B: **Continue Learning** (15 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/memphis/.cursor/worktrees/SovereignShadow_II/2J1t5
python3 agents/mentor_system.py
```
**Just learn.** The system won't let you trade live until you're ready (20 lessons + 10 paper trades).

---

### Option C: **See What the System Recommends** (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/memphis/.cursor/worktrees/SovereignShadow_II/2J1t5
python3 agents/master_trading_system.py
```
**Ask it what to do.** It will show you options. You don't have to do anything.

## 💡 THE TRUTH

**You don't need to customize anything right now.**

The system is designed to:
1. **Protect you** (paper trading mode)
2. **Teach you** (42-lesson curriculum)
3. **Guide you** (SHADE agent enforces rules)

**You can't break it. You can't lose money in paper mode.**

---

## 🕐 FOR YOUR 1-4 AM WINDOW

**Tonight, just do ONE of these:**

1. **Check your portfolio** (Option A) - See where you stand
2. **Do one lesson** (Option B) - Learn something new
3. **Ask the system** (Option C) - See what it thinks

**That's it. No pressure. No complexity.**

---

## 🛡️ REMEMBER

- **Paper trading = Safe practice** (no real money)
- **System enforces rules** (you can't override safety)
- **Education required** (system won't let you trade live until ready)
- **You're in control** (you decide when to go live)

**The system is YOUR assistant, not your boss.**

---

## ❓ STILL OVERWHELMED?

**Just run this:**
```bash
cd /Users/memphis/.cursor/worktrees/SovereignShadow_II/2J1t5
python3 agents/master_trading_system.py
```

**Then type:** `status`

**It will tell you exactly where you are and what's next.**

**No customization needed. No complexity. Just information.**

*You've got this. One step at a time.*
