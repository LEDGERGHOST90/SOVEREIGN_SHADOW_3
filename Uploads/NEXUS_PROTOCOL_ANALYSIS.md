- **GMX:** Minimize price impact through position sizing
- **Aave:** Batch lending/borrowing operations

**5. INTELLIGENT EXECUTION ROUTING**
```python
# Example Fee-Optimized Routing Logic
def optimal_execution_venue(trade_size, urgency_level):
    venues = analyze_all_venues(trade_size)
    
    if urgency_level == "LOW":
        return min(venues, key=lambda x: x.total_cost)
    elif urgency_level == "MEDIUM":
        return min(venues, key=lambda x: x.cost_per_speed_ratio)
    else:  # HIGH urgency
        return min(venues, key=lambda x: x.execution_time)
```

**6. FEE ANALYTICS & REPORTING**
