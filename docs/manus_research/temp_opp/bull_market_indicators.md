### Market Regime Interpretation

The data suggests we are NOT at a market cycle top. With 0/30 indicators hitting peak signals and average progress at only 41.16%, the market appears to be in a mid-cycle consolidation phase rather than euphoric peak conditions.

Key metrics like MVRV Z-Score (1.03) and MVRV Ratio (1.54) are well below historical peak levels (5 and 3 respectively), suggesting significant upside potential remains before cycle completion.
