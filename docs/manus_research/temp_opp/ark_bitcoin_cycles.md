### Bitcoin Halving Cycles Analysis

The fourth Bitcoin halving occurred on April 19, 2024, cutting issuance from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block. Since then, as of November 13, 2024, Bitcoin's price increased 41.2% from $64,013 to $90,446.

**Post-Halving Performance Comparison:**
| Period | Price Increase by This Point in Cycle |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Current (2024) | 41.2% |
| Previous Cycle | 53.3% |
| Cycle Before | 122.5% |

### Bear Market Drawdown Comparison

The 2022 bear market saw Bitcoin's maximum drop of "only" 76.9%, which was less severe than previous cycles:
- 2018: -86.3%
- 2015: -85.1%
- 2011: -93.5%

### Cycle Low to Current Performance

Since the last cycle low, Bitcoin price increased 5.72x, comparable to:
- 2015-2018 cycle: 5.18x at same point
- 2018-2022 cycle: 5.93x at same point

### Price Projection Based on Historical Patterns

If Bitcoin follows the average pattern of the two previous cycles, the price could increase 15.4x to approximately $243,000 during the next year (880 days after the cycle low in November 2021).

### Calendar Year Performance (2024)

By November 13, 2024:
- Year-to-date performance: 2.14x (114.1% increase)
- This outperforms the 2.06x average for all sampled years (2011-2023)
- Also outperforms the 2.04x average of halving years (2012, 2016, 2020)

### Year-End 2024 Projections

If Bitcoin matches historical averages:
- General historical average: 2.48x → ~$104,000
- Halving year average: 2.94x → ~$124,000

### Key Supply Events in 2024

Events that increased supply in circulation:
1. Release of long-dormant coins seized by German and US governments
2. Repayments to Mt. Gox creditors (from estimated 141,686 BTC at start of year to 27,877 by November 13)

### Market Dynamics

- US spot Bitcoin ETF launch in January bolstered market demand
- "Overbought" spike in Q2 2024 following ETF launch
- Prolonged "oversold" period lasting until after US Presidential Election

### ARK's Outlook

ARK anticipates a strong close to 2024 and continued momentum during 2025, contingent on:
- Continued institutional gravitation toward the asset class
- Potential US government consideration of adding Bitcoin to strategic reserves
