### Key Findings

1. **Crypto valuations follow an apparent four-year cycle** with successive periods of price appreciation and depreciation

2. **Current mix of indicators consistent with intermediate stage of the cycle** - bull market can potentially extend into 2025 and beyond if supported by fundamentals

3. **Crypto is maturing**: New spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs have broadened market access; incoming U.S. Congress may bring greater regulatory clarity

### Historical Bitcoin Cycle Analysis

| Cycle | Duration | Peak Return |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Cycle 1 | ~1 year | >500x |
| Cycle 2 | ~2 years | >500x |
| Cycle 3 (Jan 2015 - Dec 2017) | ~3 years | >100x |
| Cycle 4 (Dec 2018 - Nov 2021) | ~3 years | ~20x |
| Current Cycle (Nov 2022 - present) | ~2+ years | ~6x |

### Key On-Chain Indicators

**MVRV Ratio (Market Value to Realized Value):**
- Historical peak threshold: ≥4
- Current level (as of report): 2.6
- Interpretation: Suggests cycle has further to run, though peaks have been lower each cycle

**HODL Waves (Coins Active in Last Year vs Free Float):**
- Historical peak threshold: ≥60%
- Current level: ~54%
- Interpretation: More coins expected to change hands before prices peak

**MCTC Ratio (Miner Cap to Thermocap):**
- Historical peak threshold: ≥10
- Current level: ~6
- Interpretation: Still at intermediate point of current cycle

### Cycle Characteristics

**Price Momentum:**
- Bitcoin shows statistical momentum: gains tend to follow gains, losses tend to follow losses
- Current cycle tracking relatively close to last two market cycles
- Bitcoin's ~6x return this cycle is significantly less than returns achieved in past four cycles

### Market Maturation Factors

The report notes several factors that may reshape or diminish recurring cycles:
1. Broader adoption by traditional investors
2. Declining supply impact of four-year halving events
3. New spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs broadening market access
4. Potential regulatory clarity from U.S. Congress

### Research Conclusions

**Grayscale Research sees current indicators as consistent with an intermediate stage of the cycle.** As long as the asset class is supported by fundamentals (application adoption and broader macro market conditions), the bull market can potentially extend into 2025 and beyond.

Common indicators of the Bitcoin cycle are still below levels when prices have peaked in the past, suggesting the current bull market could continue if supported by fundamentals.

### Important Caveats

- Past cycles had unique drivers; future returns may not mirror previous experience
- On-chain indicators provide only rough guidance
- No guarantee that relationship between indicators and future price returns will resemble the past
- MVRV and MCTC ratios have peaked at lower levels each cycle
