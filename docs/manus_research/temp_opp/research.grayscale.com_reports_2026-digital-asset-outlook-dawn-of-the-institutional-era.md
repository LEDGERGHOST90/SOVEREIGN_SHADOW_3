Key Takeaways
We expect 2026 to accelerate structural shifts in digital asset investing, which have been underpinned by two major themes: macro demand for alternative stores of value and improved regulatory clarity.Together, these trends should bring in new capital, broaden adoption (especially among advised wealth and institutional investors), and bridge public blockchains more fully into mainstream financial infrastructure.
As a result, we expect rising valuations in 2026 and the end of the so-called “four-year cycle,” or the theory that crypto market direction follows a recurring four-year pattern. Bitcoin’s price will likely reach a new all-time high in the first half of the year, in our view.
Grayscale expects bipartisan crypto market structure legislation to become U.S. law in 2026. This will bring deeper integration between public blockchains and traditional finance, facilitate regulated trading of digital asset securities, and potentially allow for on-chain issuance by both startups and mature firms.
The outlook for fiat currencies is increasingly uncertain; in contrast, we can be highly confident that the 20 millionth Bitcoin will be mined in March 2026. Digital money systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum that offer transparent, programmatic, and ultimately scarce supply will be in rising demand, in our view, due to rising fiat currency risks.
We expect more crypto assets to be available through exchange-traded products in 2026. These vehicles have had a successful start, but many platforms are still conducting due diligence and working to incorporate crypto into their asset-allocation process. As this process matures, look for more slow-moving institutional capital to arrive throughout 2026.
We also outline our Top 10 Crypto Investing Themes for 2026, reflecting the breadth of use cases emerging across public blockchain technology. In each case we include the relevant crypto assets associated with each theme. They are:


Dollar Debasement Risk Drives Demand for Monetary Alternatives
Regulatory Clarity Supporting Adoption of Digital Assets
Reach of Stablecoins to Grow in Wake of GENIUS Act
Asset Tokenization at Inflection Point
Privacy Solutions Needed as Blockchain Tech Goes Mainstream
AI Centralization Calls for Blockchain Solutions
DeFi Accelerates, Led by Lending
Mainstream Adoption Will Demand Next-Generation Infrastructure
A Focus on Sustainable Revenue
Investors Seek Out Staking by Default
Finally, two topics that we do not expect to influence crypto markets in 2026:


Quantum computing: We believe that research and preparedness will continue on post-quantum cryptography, but this issue is unlikely to affect valuations in the next year.
Digital asset treasuries: Despite their media attention, we believe that DATs will not be a major swing factor for digital asset markets in 2026.

2026 Digital Asset Outlook: Dawn of the Institutional Era

Fifteen years ago, crypto was an experiment: just one asset (Bitcoin) with a market capitalization of about $1 million. Today, crypto is an emerging industry and mid-sized alternative asset class, consisting of millions of individual tokens with a combined market capitalization of about $3 trillion (Exhibit 1). Now, a more complete regulatory architecture across major economies is deepening the integration of public blockchains with traditional finance and fueling long-term capital inflows into the marketplace.

Exhibit 1: Crypto now a mid-sized alternative asset class

Along the journey from crypto’s early beginnings, token valuations have experienced four large cyclical drawdowns, or about one every four years (Exhibit 2). In three of these examples, the cyclical peak in valuations occurred 1 to 1.5 years after a Bitcoin halving event, which also happens once every four years. The current bull market has lasted more than three years, and the most recent Bitcoin halving was in April 2024, more than 1.5 years ago. Therefore, conventional wisdom among certain market participants says that Bitcoin’s price likely peaked in October, and 2026 will be a challenging year for crypto returns.

Exhibit 2: Rising valuations in 2026 will mark the end of the “four-year cycle” theory

Grayscale believes that the crypto asset class is in a sustained bull market, however, and that 2026 will mark the end of the apparent four-year cycle. We expect rising valuations across all six Crypto Sectors in 2026, and we think the price of Bitcoin could exceed its previous high in the first half of the year.

There are two main pillars to our optimistic outlook:

First, there will be ongoing macro demand for alternative stores of value. Bitcoin and Ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap[1], can be considered scarce digital commodities and alternative monetary assets. Fiat currencies (and assets denominated in fiat currencies) face additional risks due to high and rising public sector debt and its potential implications for inflation over time (Exhibit 3). Scarce commodities — whether physical gold and silver or digital Bitcoin and Ether — can potentially serve as a ballast in portfolios for fiat currency risks. As long as the risk of fiat currency debasement keeps rising, portfolio demand for Bitcoin and Ether will likely continue rising as well, in our view.

Second, regulatory clarity is driving institutional investment into public blockchain technology. It can be easy to forget, but until this year the U.S. government had outstanding investigations and/or lawsuits with many leading firms in the crypto industry, including Coinbase, Ripple, Binance, Robinhood, Consensys, Uniswap, and OpenSea. Even today, exchanges and other crypto intermediaries operate without clear spot-market guidelines.

This ship has slowly been turning. In 2023, Grayscale won its lawsuit against the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), which paved the way for spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). In 2024, Bitcoin and Ether spot ETPs came to market. In 2025, Congress passed the GENIUS Act on stablecoins and regulators shifted their approach toward crypto, working with the industry to provide clear guidance while continuing to focus on consumer protection and financial stability. In 2026, Grayscale expects Congress to pass bipartisan crypto market structure legislation, which will likely cement blockchain-based finance in U.S. capital markets and facilitate continued institutional investment (Exhibit 4).

Exhibit 4: Higher fundraising potentially a sign of institutional confidence

New capital entering the crypto ecosystem is likely to come primarily through spot ETPs, in our view. Since the Bitcoin ETPs launched in the U.S. in January 2024, global crypto ETPs have seen net inflows of $87 billion (Exhibit 5). Despite the early success of these products, the process of incorporating crypto into mainstream portfolios is still in early innings. Grayscale estimates that less than 0.5% of U.S. advised wealth is allocated to the crypto asset class.[2] This number should grow as more platforms complete their due diligence, build out capital market assumptions, and incorporate crypto into model portfolios. Beyond advised wealth, early movers have already adopted crypto ETPs in institutional portfolios, including Harvard Management Company and Mubadala (one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds).[3] We expect this list to grow significantly in 2026.

Exhibit 5: Persistent inflows into spot crypto ETPs

With crypto increasingly driven by institutional capital inflows, the nature of price performance has changed. In each prior bull market, Bitcoin’s price increased by at least 1,000% over a one-year period (Exhibit 6). This time around, the maximum year-over-year price increase was about 240% (in the year to March 2024). We think the difference reflects steadier institutional buying recently compared to retail momentum chasing in past cycles. Although crypto investing involves significant risks, we believe the probability of a deep and prolonged cyclical drawdown in prices is relatively low at the time of writing. Instead, a steadier advance in prices, driven by institutional capital inflows, is more likely next year, in our view.

Exhibit 6: No dramatic surge in Bitcoin price this cycle

A supportive macro market backdrop may also limit some downside risks to token prices in 2026. The last two cyclical peaks occurred when the Fed was raising rates (Exhibit 7). In contrast, the Federal Reserve cut rates three times in 2025 and is expected to keep reducing rates next year. Kevin Hassett, who may replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, recently told Face the Nation: “The American people can expect President Trump to pick somebody who’s going to help them have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates."[4] Generally speaking, a growing economy and broadly supportive Fed policy should be consistent with favorable investor risk appetite and potential gains in risky assets, including crypto.

Exhibit 7: Prior cyclical peaks have been associated with Fed rate hikes

Like every other asset class, crypto is driven by a combination of fundamentals and capital flows. Commodity markets are cyclical, and crypto may have prolonged cyclical drawdowns at certain points in the future. But we don’t see it for 2026. The fundamentals look solid: we expect ongoing macro demand for alternative stores of value, and regulatory clarity to drive institutional investment into public blockchain technology. Moreover, new capital is still coming to the market: crypto ETPs will likely be in many more portfolios by the end of next year. This cycle, there has not been one large wave of retail demand, but rather a steady bid for crypto ETPs from a wide range of portfolios. With a broadly supportive macro backdrop, we think these are the conditions for new highs for the crypto asset class in 2026.

Top 10 Crypto Investing Themes for 2026

Crypto is a diverse asset class, reflecting the many use cases of public blockchain technology. The following section outlines Grayscale’s view on the 10 most important crypto investing themes for 2026 — plus two “red herrings.” For each theme, we list the most relevant tokens from our perspective. For more background on the types of investable digital assets, see our Crypto Sectors framework.

Theme #1: Dollar Debasement Risk Drives Demand for Monetary Alternatives

Relevant crypto assets: BTC, ETH, ZEC

The U.S. economy has a debt problem (revisit Exhibit 3), which may ultimately put pressure on the Dollar’s role as a store of value. Other countries face similar issues, but the Dollar is the dominant international currency in the world today, so U.S. policy credibility matters more for potential capital flows. A small subset of digital assets can be considered viable stores of value, in our view, because of sufficiently broad adoption, a high degree of decentralization, and limited supply growth. This includes the two largest crypto assets by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ether. Like physical gold, their utility derives partly from the fact that they are scarce and autonomous.

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins and is entirely programmatic. For example, we can confidently predict that the 20 millionth Bitcoin will be mined in March 2026. A digital money system with transparent, predictable, and ultimately scarce supply is a simple idea, but it has rising appeal in today’s economy due to fiat currency tail risks. As long as the macro imbalances creating fiat currency risk keep rising, portfolio demand for alternative stores of value may continue to rise as well (Exhibit 8). Zcash, a smaller decentralized digital currency with privacy features, may also be appropriate for portfolios positioning for Dollar debasement (see Theme #5).

Exhibit 8: Macro imbalances may drive demand to alternative stores of value

Theme #2: Regulatory Clarity Supporting Adoption of Digital Assets

Relevant crypto assets: Almost all

The U.S. made big strides toward crypto regulatory clarity in 2025, including passing the GENIUS Act (on stablecoins), rescinding SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (on custody), introducing Generic Listing Standards for crypto ETPs, and addressing traditional banking access for the crypto industry (Exhibit 9). Next year we expect another major step forward with the passing of bipartisan market structure legislation. The House passed its version of this legislation in July — known as the Clarity Act — and the Senate has since taken up its own process. While there are many details to be ironed out, broadly speaking the legislation provides a traditional finance rulebook for crypto capital markets, including registration and disclosure requirements, classifications of crypto assets, and rules for insiders.

In practice, a more complete regulatory framework for crypto assets across the U.S. and other major economies could mean that regulated financial services firms report digital assets on balance sheet and begin transacting on the blockchain. It may also allow for on-chain capital formation, with both startups and mature firms issuing regulated tokens. By further unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology, regulatory clarity should help lift the crypto asset class in general. Because of the potential importance of regulatory clarity in driving the crypto asset class in 2026, a breakdown of bipartisan process in legislation in Congress should be considered a downside risk, in our view.

Theme #3: Reach of Stablecoins to Grow in Wake of GENIUS Act

Relevant crypto assets: ETH, TRX, BNB, SOL, XPL, LINK

Stablecoins had their breakout moment in 2025: outstanding supply reached $300 billion and monthly transactions averaged $1.1 trillion per month over the six months ending in November[5], the U.S. Congress passed the GENIUS Act, and a wave of institutional capital poured into the industry (Exhibit 10). In 2026 we expect to see the practical results: stablecoins integrated into cross-border payments services, stablecoins as collateral on derivatives exchanges, stablecoins on corporate balance sheets, and stablecoins as an alternative to credit cards in online consumer payments. Continued growth in the popularity of prediction markets may also drive new demand for stablecoins. Higher stablecoin volumes should benefit the blockchains that record these transactions (e.g., ETH, TRX, BNB, and SOL, among many others), as well as a variety of supporting infrastructure (e.g., LINK) and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications (see Theme #7).

Exhibit 10: Stablecoins having a breakout moment

Theme #4: Asset Tokenization at Inflection Point

Relevant crypto assets: LINK, ETH, SOL, AVAX, BNB, CC

Tokenized assets are tiny today: just 0.01% of global equity and bond market capitalization (Exhibit 11). Grayscale expects rapid growth in asset tokenization over the coming years, facilitated by more mature blockchain technology and improved regulatory clarity. By 2030, it would not be surprising to see tokenized assets grow by ~1,000x, in our view. This growth will likely drive value to the blockchains that process transactions in tokenized assets, as well as a variety of supporting applications. The leading blockchains for tokenized assets today[6] are Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain (BNB), and Solana (SOL), although this list will likely evolve over time. In terms of supporting applications, Chainlink (LINK) looks especially well placed, given its unique suite of software technologies.

Exhibit 11: Scope for enormous growth in tokenized assets

Theme #5: Privacy Solutions Needed as Blockchain Tech Goes Mainstream

Relevant crypto assets: ZEC, AZTEC, RAIL
