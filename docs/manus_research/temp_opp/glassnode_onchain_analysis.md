# Glassnode On-Chain Analysis - December 2025

## Source: Glassnode Insights "Trapped Under Overhead Supply" (Dec 17, 2025)

### Executive Summary
- Bitcoin remains confined within a structurally fragile range
- Recent rejection near $93k with gradual drift lower toward $85.6k
- Dense distribution between $93k–$120k continues to cap recovery attempts
- Failure to reclaim 0.75 quantile (~$95k) and Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at $101.5k keeps upside constrained

### Key On-Chain Metrics

**Supply in Loss:**
- Supply in loss has risen to 6.7 million BTC (7D-SMA)
- Highest level of loss-bearing supply observed in this cycle
- Persisting within 6–7 million BTC range since mid-November
- Pattern mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles

**Supply Distribution:**
- 23.7% of circulating supply currently underwater
- 10.2% held by long-term holders (LTH)
- 13.5% held by short-term holders (STH)
- Loss-bearing supply accumulated by recent buyers gradually maturing into LTH cohort

**Loss Sellers:**
- Supply attributed to Loss Sellers has climbed to ~360k BTC
- Break below True Market Mean at $81.3k risks expanding this cohort further

### Support/Resistance Levels
- Overhead supply: $93k–$120k range
- Key resistance: $93k (recent rejection), $95k (0.75 quantile), $101.5k (STH Cost Basis)
- Key support: $81.3k (True Market Mean), $81k–$89k fragile range

### Market Structure Assessment
- Top-heavy market structure similar to early 2022
- Recovery attempts increasingly capped by overhead sell pressure
- Time-driven stress test on investors with weaker conviction

### Spot Market Analysis
- Spot demand lacks persistence
- Periodic bursts of buy-side activity but no sustained accumulation
- Coinbase CVD relatively constructive (US-based investors)
- Binance and aggregate flows remain choppy and directionless
- Dip-buying remains tactical and short-term

### Corporate Treasury Activity
- Treasury flows remain episodic, not systematic
- Sporadic large inflows from small subset of firms
- Recent price weakness has not triggered coordinated accumulation
- Corporates remain disciplined and price-sensitive

### Futures Market
- Open interest trending lower from cycle highs
- Funding rates oscillating around neutral
- Ongoing position reduction rather than fresh leverage deployment
- Drawdown not driven by excessive long positioning
- Lack of speculative conviction rather than forced deleveraging

### Options Market
- Range-bound regime reinforced
- Front-end volatility compressed post-FOMC
- Downside risk priced but stable
- Flows favor premium harvesting over directional bets
- Large December expiries pinning price action into year-end

### Market Regime Classification
- Structurally fragile, range-bound market
- Time-driven sell pressure dominant
- Similar to early 2022 transitional phase
- Risk of further corrective downside if key support breaks
