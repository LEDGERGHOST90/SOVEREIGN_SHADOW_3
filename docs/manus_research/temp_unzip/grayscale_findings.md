# Grayscale Research Findings - Crypto Cycle State

**Source:** Grayscale Research Report "The State of the Crypto Cycle"
**Authors:** Zach Pandl, Michael Zhao
**Last Updated:** 5/29/2024

## Key Metrics and Quantitative Data

### MVRV Ratio
- Current level: 2.6
- Historical cycle peaks: At least 4 in each of last four cycles
- Interpretation: Intermediate stage, not yet at prior market tops

### Bitcoin Free Float Activity
- Current: ~54% of free float supply transacted on-chain in last year
- Historical threshold: 60%+ at cycle peaks
- Interpretation: More coins expected to change hands before peak

### MCTC Ratio (Miner Cap to Thermocap)
- Current: ~6
- Historical threshold: 10+ at cycle peaks
- Interpretation: Intermediate point of current cycle

### Bitcoin Cycle Performance
- Current cycle: ~6x return from Nov 2022 low (~$16k)
- Previous cycles: 20x (2018-2021), 100x+ (2015-2017), 500x+ (earlier cycles)
- Duration: Current bull market ~2 years, previous cycles lasted ~3 years

### ETF Inflows
- Total net inflows: $36.7 billion (as of Dec 11, 2024)
- Significance: Broadened institutional access

### Altcoin Open Interest
- Pre-liquidation peak: ~$54 billion across top 3 perpetual futures exchanges
- Post-liquidation: Declined by ~$10 billion but remains elevated
- Interpretation: High speculative length, potential late-cycle indicator

### Funding Rates
- Current: Meaningfully positive but below earlier 2024 highs
- Interpretation: Moderate speculative length, not mature cycle

## Regime Assessment
- **Current Stage:** Intermediate stage of crypto market cycle
- **Outlook:** Bull market can potentially extend into 2025 and beyond if supported by fundamentals
- **Key Fundamentals:** Application adoption, macro market conditions, regulatory clarity

## Historical Cycle Patterns
1. Cycle 1: <1 year, 500x+ returns
2. Cycle 2: ~2 years, 500x+ returns
3. Cycle 3 (Jan 2015 - Dec 2017): ~3 years, 100x+ returns
4. Cycle 4 (Dec 2018 - Nov 2021): ~3 years, ~20x returns
5. Current cycle (Nov 2022 - present): ~2 years, ~6x returns so far

# Fidelity Digital Assets Research - Bitcoin Price Phases

**Source:** Fidelity Digital Assets Research
**Author:** Zack Wainwright
**Date:** February 24, 2025

## Bitcoin Price Phase Framework

Fidelity defines four distinct phases based on percentage of addresses in profit and one-year realized volatility:

### Phase Definitions

| Phase | Volatility | Addresses in Profit | Characteristics |
|-------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Reversal | High | Low (<95%) | Bear market onset, rapid price decline |
| Bottoming | Low | Low (<95%) | Quiet period, subdued activity, gradual recovery |
| Appreciation | Low | High (>95%) | Renewed optimism, new ATH after extended time below |
| Acceleration | High | High (>95%) | Excitement, price discovery, cycle peak |

### Current Cycle Status (as of Feb 2025)

- **Current Phase:** Acceleration Phase
- **Phase Start:** July 15, 2024 (when 1-year realized volatility surpassed 5th percentile)
- **Appreciation Phase:** Feb 26, 2024 - July 14, 2024 (68 days)
- **Key Milestone:** March 4, 2024 - New ATH closing high near $69,000

### Historical Cycle Comparison

The 2024-2025 Acceleration Phase behaves similarly to 2013 and 2017 cycles:
- Blow-off top historically happens later in the phase
- Diminishing returns each cycle
- **Projected potential top:** Q2 2025

### Volatility Metrics

- High profit threshold: >95% of addresses in profit
- Low volatility threshold: Below 5th percentile of all 1-year realized volatility data (July 19, 2010 - Feb 4, 2025)
- Current status: Over midway point of Acceleration Phase from historical perspective

### Key Insight

The Bottoming Phase first appeared June 13, 2023, when Bitcoin was at $25,897, signaling the high volatility from March 2017 was subsiding - an early indicator of the bullish move that developed in 2024.

# Academic Research: Market Microstructure

## Paper 1: Microstructure and Market Dynamics in Crypto Markets

**Authors:** Maureen O'Hara (Cornell), David Easley (Cornell), Songshan Yang (Renmin University), Zhibai Zhang (NYU)
**Posted:** July 3, 2025
**Pages:** 47
**Source:** SSRN (abstract_id=5337672)

### Key Findings

The study investigates market microstructure metrics for five major cryptocurrencies and demonstrates:

1. **Predictive Power:** Microstructure measures of liquidity and price discovery have predictive power for price dynamics used in electronic market making, dynamic hedging strategies, and volatility estimation.

2. **Cross-Market Effects:** Identified own market and cross-market effects for Roll measures and VPINs (Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading) in BTC and ETH.

3. **Stability During Crypto Winter:** Results showed little change during crypto winter, demonstrating stability to these effects.

4. **Regulatory Implications:** Cryptocurrency market dynamics are similar to futures markets, suggesting regulation of crypto might benefit from a similar regulatory structure.

### Metrics Analyzed
- Roll measures (liquidity indicator)
- VPIN (informed trading probability)
- Price discovery metrics
- Volatility estimation measures
