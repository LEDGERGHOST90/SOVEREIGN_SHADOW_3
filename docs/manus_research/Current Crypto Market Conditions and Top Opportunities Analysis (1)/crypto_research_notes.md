## Source 3: The DeFi Report - BTC Onchain Data Update (December 17, 2025)
Author: Michael Nadeau

### Monetary Policy Analysis:

**Fed Actions:**
- Rate cut to target range of 3.50%-3.75% (December 2025)
- 3rd rate cut this year, 6th since September 2024
- Total cuts: 175 basis points
- Fed Fund Rate at lowest level in ~3 years
- New "Reserve Management Purchases" of T-Bills at $40B/month starting December

**Key Distinction - NOT QE:**
The report argues this is NOT quantitative easing because:
1. T-bill purchases do not remove duration from the market
2. No suppression of long-end yields
3. Financial conditions are not broadly eased
4. 84% of Treasury issuance is already bills

**What Would Signal True Easing:**
- Fed artificially suppresses long end of yield curve
- Real rates fall due to rising inflation expectations
- Corporate borrowing costs decline
- Term premium compresses
- Equity discount rates fall
- Mortgage rates fall

**Big Picture - Dollar Devaluation Thesis:**
- U.S. moving toward reshoring manufacturing
- Conflicts with dollar's reserve currency role
- Since 1/1/2000: $14 trillion+ rise in equity value from foreign capital
- Nearly $16 trillion outflow for goods
- China artificially suppressing Yuan
- Dollar artificially overvalued
- Forced dollar devaluation expected on horizon
- BTC and gold positioned as non-sovereign stores of value

**Market Psychology:**
- Still leaning risk-on
- Investors overfit bullish narratives to policy headlines
- Volatility expected to pick up significantly in Q1 2026

**Title:** Market Regime Analysis Across Asset Classes: A UMAP Clustering Study of Cryptocurrency, Forex, and Equity Markets
**Author:** Igor Rivin, Temple University - Mathematics Department
**Date Written:** November 11, 2025
**Posted:** December 12, 2025
**DOI:** 10.2139/ssrn.5857822

### Key Findings:

**Methodology:** UMAP dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering on intraday price patterns (2021-2024)

**Bitcoin Regime Characteristics:**
- Distinct "trendy" regime-switching behavior
- Extreme asymmetry: 75% bear days, 25% bull days
- Excellent cluster separation (silhouette score: 0.83)

**Traditional Markets (EUR/USD, AAPL, QQQ):**
- Balanced, symmetric mean-reverting characteristics
- 50/50 split between up and down days
- Moderate cluster separation (0.55-0.59)

**Volatility Hierarchy:**
- Bitcoin: 1.05%
- Equities: 0.35-0.40%
- Forex: 0.18%

**Key Insight:** Fundamental structural differences exist between cryptocurrency markets and traditional markets. Bitcoin exhibits distinct regime-switching behavior compared to mean-reverting traditional assets.

**Title:** The Crypto Cycle and US Monetary Policy
**Authors:** Natasha Che, Alexander Copestake, Davide Furceri, and Tammaro Terracciano
**Department:** Asia and Pacific Department, International Monetary Fund
**JEL Classification:** E44; E52; F33
**Keywords:** US Monetary Policy; Cryptoassets; Stock Markets

### Key Findings:

**Common Crypto Cycle:**
- Identified a single price component called the "crypto factor" that explains 80% of variation in crypto prices
- Increasing correlation with equity markets coincided with entry of institutional investors

**Monetary Policy Impact:**
- US Fed tightening reduces the crypto factor through the risk-taking channel
- Contradicts claims that crypto assets provide a hedge against market risk

**Model Insights:**
- Stylized heterogeneous-agent model with time-varying aggregate risk aversion explains empirical findings
- Highlights possible spillovers from crypto to equity markets if institutional participation becomes large

**Implication:** Crypto markets are increasingly correlated with traditional risk assets and respond to Fed policy through the same risk-taking channel as equities.

**Date:** December 17, 2025
**Authors:** CryptoVizArt, Antoine Colpaert, Chris Beamish, Glassnode

### Executive Summary:
Bitcoin remains confined within a structurally fragile range with rejection near $93k and drift toward $85.6k. Dense distribution between $93k-$120k continues to cap recovery attempts.

### Key On-Chain Metrics:

**Supply in Loss:**
- 6.7 million BTC (7D-SMA) held at a loss - highest level in this cycle
- Persisting in 6-7 million BTC range since mid-November
- Pattern mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles

**Supply Distribution by Holder Type:**
- 23.7% of circulating supply currently underwater
- 10.2% held by Long-Term Holders (LTH) at loss
- 13.5% held by Short-Term Holders (STH) at loss

**Critical Price Levels:**
- True Market Mean: $81.3k (key support)
- Short-Term Holder Cost Basis: $101.5k
- 0.75 Quantile: ~$95k
- Overhead supply range: $93k-$120k

**Loss Sellers:**
- Supply attributed to Loss Sellers: ~360k BTC
- Break below True Market Mean ($81.3k) risks expanding loss seller cohort

**Realized Cap:**
- Record $1.125 trillion (all-time high)
- Continues rising despite 36% price correction

### Market Structure Analysis:

**Spot Market:**
- Demand lacks persistence
- Coinbase CVD relatively constructive (US-based investors)
- Binance and aggregate flows choppy and directionless
- Dip-buying remains tactical and short-term

**Futures Market:**
- Open interest trending lower from cycle highs
- Funding rates oscillating around neutral
- De-risking continues, not forced deleveraging
- Lack of speculative conviction

**Options Market:**
- Range-bound regime
- Front-end volatility compressed post-FOMC
- Downside risk priced but stable
- Large December expiries pinning price action

### Comparison to Prior Cycles:
Market structure mirrors early 2022 with over 25% of supply underwater. Recovery attempts capped by overhead sell pressure, similar to early stages of bearish phases in prior cycles.

## Source 8: CoinDesk - Bitcoin Realized Cap Analysis (December 18, 2025)

### Key Data Points:

**Realized Capitalization:**
- All-time high: $1.125 trillion
- Continues rising through 36% price correction
- Values each bitcoin at price it last moved (actual capital inflows vs speculative price action)

**Historical Comparison:**
- 2022 bear market: Realized cap fell from ~$470B to $385B
- Current correction: Realized cap continues rising (bullish signal)
- Similar pause seen during April 2025 tariff tantrum when BTC bottomed near $76,000

### Expert Analysis - Andre Dragosch (Bitwise European Head of Research):

**Four-Year Cycle Challenged:**
- Bitcoin could defy four-year cycle narrative
- Upside surprises possible in 2026
- Resilient global growth + ongoing rate cuts = steepening yield curve + expanding liquidity

**Macro Backdrop:**
- "Bitcoin is materially underpricing the prevailing macro backdrop"
- Degree of underpricing last seen during Covid recession and FTX collapse
- No signs of U.S. recession
- Evidence of re-accelerating growth
- Conditions historically supportive for Bitcoin (weakening dollar environment)

### Current Price Data (December 18, 2025):
- BTC: $85,517.91 (+1.05%)
- ETH: $2,827.73 (+0.48%)
- SOL: $119.61 (+3.39%)
- XRP: $1.82 (+2.82%)

### Market Liquidations:
- $550 million in liquidations hit derivatives markets
- Analysts: Pullback looks like orderly deleveraging rather than full-blown capitulation

## Source 9: Kaiko Research - Bitcoin's Halving Anniversary Analysis (April 22, 2025)

### Historical Halving Performance Comparison:

| Halving Year | Post-Halving 12-Month Return |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| 2012         | +7,000%                      |
| 2016         | +291%                        |
| 2020         | +541%                        |
| 2024         | Weakest on record (BTC at $80-90k range) |

### Key Findings:

**2024 Cycle Underperformance:**
- One year after April 2024 halving, Bitcoin trading between $80,000-$90,000
- Weakest post-halving performance on record in percentage growth terms
- Price momentum that typically materializes 9 months post-halving notably absent

**Macroeconomic Context:**
Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (FRED) averages during 6 months post-halving:
- 2012: 107
- 2016: 109
- 2020: 186
- 2024: 317 (significantly elevated)

**Volatility Decline:**
- 60-day price volatility dropped from over 200% (2012) to barely 50% (2024)
- Bitcoin maturing with more stable but potentially subdued returns

**Miner Dynamics:**
- Hash rate reached all-time high in April 2025
- Miner profit margins squeezed when hash rate rises without price increase
- Transaction fees since 2024 halving: ~8,000 BTC
- Transaction fees after 2020 halving (first year): 37,000 BTC
- Block reward now 3.125 BTC

### Structural Changes:
- Regulatory clarity emerging in U.S.
- Growing disconnect between network security (hash rate) and price performance
- Runes protocol launch briefly spiked transaction fees post-halving
