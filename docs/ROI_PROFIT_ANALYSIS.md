- Tier 3 (Blue-chip): Hit T1 only (30% of full ladder)
- Tier 4 (Emerging): 50% hit T1, 50% break even

| Tier | Capital | Profit | ROI | Performance |
|------|---------|--------|-----|-------------|
| Mid-Cap | $350 | **$115.40** | 33% | Strong performance |

## 💡 EXPECTED VALUE CALCULATION

### Probability-Weighted Expected Return:

```
Expected Profit = (0.15 × $209.25) + (0.50 × $94.50) + (0.30 × $52.35) + (0.05 × -$30.00)
                = $31.39 + $47.25 + $15.71 - $1.50
                = $92.85

Expected ROI = $92.85 / $600 = 15.5%
```

**Expected Portfolio Value**: $692.85

To achieve Conservative Case (+8.7%):
- Need 50% of trades to hit T1
- Need 25% to hit T2

To achieve Realistic Case (+15.8%):
- Need 70% of trades to hit T1+T2
- Need 30% to hit T3

To achieve Best Case (+34.9%):
