## 🔄 REBALANCING STRATEGY

### OPTION 1: Close AAVE Position (RECOMMENDED)
**Why**: You're paying -1.63% APY. Close it and redeploy to Core 4.

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Use XRP to repay AAVE debt
2. ✅ Withdraw all wstETH collateral
3. ✅ Convert wstETH → ETH
4. ✅ Rebalance everything to target

**Detailed Execution**:

#### Step 1: Repay AAVE Debt
- Swap 330 XRP → $682 USDC (on Ledger using DeFi swap)
- In AAVE: Repay $661 debt (all of it)
- Result: 0 debt, can withdraw all collateral

#### Step 2: Withdraw Collateral
- Withdraw 0.8217638 wstETH from AAVE
- You now have liquid: $2,846 wstETH

#### Step 3: Convert wstETH to ETH
- Unwrap wstETH → stETH (1:1 on Lido)
- You get ~0.82 stETH worth $2,846
- stETH is liquid and earns staking rewards (~3% APY)

#### Step 4: Rebalance to Target

**New inventory after Steps 1-3**:
- stETH: ~0.82 = $2,846
- BTC: 0.0165 = $1,438
- XRP: 167 = $348 (497 - 330 sold)
- USDC: $54
- Small ETH: $14
- **Total**: $4,700

**Execute these swaps** (on Ledger or exchange):

**SELLS**:
- Sell 60 XRP → $124 USDC
- Result: XRP position = $224 (too low, adjust below)

**BUYS**:
- Buy 0.0052 BTC with $450 USDC
- Buy 0.396 ETH with $1,402 USDC (keep stETH separate or convert)
- Buy 4.3 SOL with $943 USDC

**Wait, need to adjust for XRP target...**

Let me recalculate properly:

**Simplified rebalancing** (after closing AAVE):

**Starting with**:
- stETH: $2,846
- BTC: $1,438
- XRP: $348 (after paying AAVE debt with 330 XRP)
- USDC: $54
- Dust: $14
**Total: $4,700**

**To hit targets, execute**:

1. **Convert stETH**:
   - Swap $1,430 stETH → BTC (to bring BTC from $1,438 to $1,888)
   - Keep $1,416 stETH as your ETH position (it IS staked ETH)
   - Wait, that's only $450 BTC buy needed, so:
   - Swap $450 stETH → BTC
   - Keep $1,416 stETH as ETH allocation
   - Swap $980 stETH → SOL

2. **Adjust XRP**:
   - Buy $124 XRP (to bring XRP from $348 to $472 target)

**FINAL SWAPS**:
- $450 stETH → BTC ✅ Brings BTC to $1,888 (40%)
- $980 stETH → SOL ✅ Brings SOL to $944 (20%)
- Keep $1,416 stETH as ETH ✅ (30%)
- $124 USDC → XRP ✅ Brings XRP to $472 (10%)

### OPTION 2: Keep AAVE Position
**Why**: If you don't want to mess with DeFi right now.

**Problem**: You're losing -1.63% APY and only 38% allocated to Core 4.

**Not recommended** - you're bleeding money daily.

| SOL | 4.3 | $944 | 20.0% | 20% | ✅ |
| XRP | 228 | $472 | 10.0% | 10% | ✅ |

**Portfolio**: $4,721 properly allocated
**Earning**: stETH 3% APY (not losing -1.63%)
**Risk**: Diversified across 4 assets
**Ready**: For growth when market moves

## 🛡️ GOING FORWARD

**NEW RULES**:

2. Rebalance quarterly (or when any asset hits ±10% from target)
3. No borrowing unless yield is positive
4. Keep it simple: Core 4 only
5. Track every move in trade journal

**Your system is built. Now USE it.**
