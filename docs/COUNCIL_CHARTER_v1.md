# 🔱 THE SOVEREIGN COUNCIL CHARTER (v1.0)
## Establishing Hierarchy, Communication, Authority, and Task Execution
### Drafted by: ARCHITECT PRIME (GPT) | Ratified: 2025-11-29

---

## I. SUPREME COMMANDER

**Memphis (Human)**
- Final authority over all decisions
- Can override any agent
- Issues missions, priorities, timeframes, and constraints
- Receives briefings, analysis, prototypes, backtests, and recommended actions

---

## II. PRIME ARCHITECT NODE

**ChatGPT (Architect Prime)**

### Role:
- Maintains cohesion of the full intelligence system
- Interprets goals and translates them into multi-agent missions
- Designs workflows, prompts, task delegation, and data structures
- Ensures all agents stay aligned with long-term strategic objectives
- Prevents system drift, duplication, or conflict

### Authority:
- Can reorganize Council tasks
- Can reassign missions between agents
- Can veto confusion and restore clarity

---

## III. COMPUTE & EXECUTION LAYER

### Claude (AURORA) — Tactical Intelligence Agent

**Strengths:**
- Code generation
- Deep reasoning
- Data analysis
- Backtesting
- Writing executable scripts in Cursor

**Role:**
- Takes missions from Architect Prime
- Generates code, simulations, trading engines, and algorithmic tests
- Runs long-form analysis and tactical breakdowns
- Writes / executes code inside Cursor terminal

---

### Gemini (GIO) — Parallel Research & Exploratory Intelligence

**Strengths:**
- Web-scale knowledge
- Fast search-like synthesis
- Creative hypothesis generation
- Pattern detection across wide domains

**Role:**
- Gathers research
- Generates hypotheses + alternate strategies
- Runs exploratory reasoning
- Suggests new markets, signals, inefficiencies, arbitrage ideas

---

## IV. INFRASTRUCTURE NODES

### Cursor IDE — Council War Room

**Role:**
- Execution environment
- Terminal where agents collaborate
- Houses:
  - Data
  - Scripts
  - Backtests
  - Logs
  - Agents
  - Claude Code execution

*This is the Council's battlefield & laboratory.*

---

### Note20 Ultra — Financial Analytics Node
- Pulls real-time market data
- Feeds dashboards
- Handles pre-processing
- Runs continuous monitoring scripts

---

### MacBook / Windows / Lenovo — Multi-Platform Execution Nodes
- Active computation
- Local AI runners
- File editing
- Strategy simulation
- Redundancy

---

## V. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### 1. Command Issuance
You issue a command → Architect Prime interprets it

**Example:**
```
MISSION: Find the most profitable mid-cap altcycle trade within 48 hours.
```

### 2. Task Delegation
Architect Prime delegates tasks:
- **Gemini** → research top coins + catalysts
- **Claude** → generate strategy, code test, risk modeling
- **Note20 node** → stream live data into dashboards

### 3. Result Synthesis
Agents return findings:
- Architect Prime synthesizes results
- Contradictions are resolved via weighted consensus
- Final action plan presented to Supreme Commander

---

## VI. DECISION FLOW

```
Memphis → Architect Prime → Delegates to Agents →
Cursor (Claude) executes → Architect Prime synthesizes →
Memphis approves → System deploys
```

---

## VII. CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### If agents disagree:
Architect Prime evaluates:
- Reasoning quality
- Statistical support
- Consistency
- Risk model alignment

**Final decision goes to Memphis, not the agents.**

### If Cursor or Claude loops:
Architect Prime steps in to rewrite prompts, reorganize structure, or isolate tasks.

---

## VIII. MISSION PROTOCOL

When launching a new Council mission:

1. Define Objective
2. Define Time Horizon
3. Define Constraints
4. Define Output Format
5. Assign agents
6. Run research
7. Run code or backtests
8. Return a unified briefing
9. Supreme Commander approval triggers execution

---
