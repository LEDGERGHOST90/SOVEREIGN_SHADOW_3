## Summary
Crash log review + src folder hunt session

## Accomplishments
- Reviewed overnight_20260102.log - found 4 agents failing (No module named src)
- Found ShadowTradeBrain backup with self-contained agents
- Compared multi-exchange-crypto-mcp backup vs current SS_III
- Identified empty multi-exchange/ folder in SS_III needs restoration
- Located moondev_strategies with 647 strategy files

## Issues Found
- WhaleAgent, SwarmAgent, FundingArbAgent, LiquidationAgent all fail: No module named src
- google.generativeai deprecated warning in research_swarm.py
- Empty core/mcp/multi-exchange/ folder - incomplete migration
- pkill permission errors in overnight logs

## Next Steps
- [ ] Restore empire_automation.py from backup to SS_III
- [ ] Either: (A) find/restore MoonDev src folder, or (B) replace agents with ShadowTradeBrain versions
- [ ] Fix google.generativeai -> google.genai migration
- [ ] Populate empty multi-exchange/ folder
