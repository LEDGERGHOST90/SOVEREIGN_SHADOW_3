## 💡 SUGGESTIONS

1. **MARKET TIMING**: Market is down 5-7% across majors. Potential accumulation zone IF support holds. Watch BTC $85K and ETH $2,800 levels.

2. **PAPER FIRST**: Stick to the plan - NO live trades until >60% win rate on paper. December Campaign discipline is key.

3. **AAVE POSITION**: Health factor 3.71 is safe. No action needed unless ETH drops below $2,400.

4. **EXCHANGE CAPITAL**: $73 USDC on Binance US ready for quick entries. Keep powder dry.

5. **AUTOMATION**: Scanner running every 15 min. Let the system find opportunities - don't chase.
