## Status
- **Mode**: Paper trading / Learning
- **Live Trades**: NONE
- **Capital**: ~$78 (not deployed)

## Accomplishments

### MoonDev Strategy Research
- Batch tested 450 Moon Dev strategies against 1yr BTC data
- Only 5 profitable (1.1%) - realistic result
- Top 3 identified:
  - MomentumBreakout_AI7: +12.5%, Sharpe 1.14
  - BandedMACD: +6.9%, high frequency
  - VolCliffArbitrage: +6.4%, 75% win rate

### Code Created
- `core/signals/moondev_signals.py` - Top 3 strategies as signal generators
- `bin/batch_strategy_tester.py` - Systematic strategy testing
- `core/strategies/funding_arb.py` - Funding rate scanner (info only)
- `research/moondev_strategies/TOP_10_STRATEGIES.md` - Documentation

### Integration Work
- Wired MoonDev signals into `realtime_risk_bridge.py`
- Now 6 modules connected: SENTINEL, ORACLE, REGIME, FLOW, REFLECT, MOONDEV
- Wired into `trading_swarm.py` for BTC/ETH signal generation

### GitHub Strategy Swarm Research
- Searched for Jane Street style strategies with proven backtests
- Key finding: Most GitHub strategies fail after fees
- Best documented: KushaalSM/Stat_Arb (82% WR, 10K trades)
- Funding rate arb requires more capital than available

## Key Realizations
- Edge at $78 = survival + education, not fancy strategies
- Evolutionary limits beaten by systematic rules, not willpower
- "Hippocampus" memory system was noise - removed
- Most value comes from NOT trading while learning

## Trades/Positions
- NONE - Paper trading mode
- Previous AI basket positions (FET/RENDER/SUI) cancelled

## Next Steps
- Continue paper trading
- Watch MoonDev signals for patterns
- Build experience before deploying capital
