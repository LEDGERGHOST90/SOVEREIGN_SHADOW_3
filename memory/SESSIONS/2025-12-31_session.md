# Session: 2025-12-31

## Accomplishments
- Updated BRAIN.json with live Coinbase balance ($741.63)
- **MAJOR STRATEGY PIVOT**: Reclassified AAVE debt as "strategic good debt"
- Updated mission from DEBT_DESTROYER to PORTFOLIO_GROWTH
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new mission and AAVE rules
- Diagnosed MCP server errors in Claude Desktop logs
- Checked Replit status (frontend broken, API working but Coinbase scope issue)

## Strategy Changes
- **OLD**: DELEVERAGE FIRST - pay off $662 AAVE debt
- **NEW**: PORTFOLIO_GROWTH - AAVE debt is strategic leverage (keep it)
- AAVE Rules (HARDCODED):
  - Min Health Factor: 2.5 (current: 3.98)
  - Debt Status: LOCKED IN as good debt
  - DO NOT repay unless HF drops below threshold

## Portfolio Status
- Net Worth: ~$5,415
- Coinbase: $741.63 (AI basket + dust)
- AAVE Collateral: $2,988 (wstETH)
- AAVE Debt: $609 (KEEP)
- Health Factor: 3.98

## AI Basket Performance
| Token | Qty | Entry | Current | P&L |
|-------|-----|-------|---------|-----|
| FET | 916.1 | $0.21 | $0.21 | $0 |
| RENDER | 123.8 | $1.28 | $1.53 | +$31 |
| SUI | 90.7 | $1.44 | $1.45 | +$1 |
| **Total** | | $481 | $513 | **+$32** |

## System Status
- Overnight Runner: STOPPED (last run Dec 28)
- Replit Dashboard: Frontend broken (React build issue)
- Replit API: Working but Coinbase needs `wallet:accounts:read` scope

## Key Decisions
- AAVE debt reclassified as good debt (strategic leverage)
- Focus shifted from debt repayment to portfolio growth
- Kill switch HF threshold raised from 2.0 to 2.5

## Next Steps
- [ ] Restart overnight runner if needed
- [ ] Fix Replit Coinbase API scope
- [ ] Monitor AI basket for exit opportunities
- [ ] Consider new positions with freed mental capital
