# SESSION: December 14, 2025

## WHAT GOT DONE

### Cleanup
- Replit download extracted and cleaned (`_REPLIT_FRESH/`)
- DS-STAR modules merged (5 new: ai_terminal, data_feeds, portfolio, voice_alerts, vector_store)
- Google Drive cleaned (`moneymemphis@gmail.com`)
- CONTEXT_REAL.md synced to Google Drive

### Skills Updated
- `ds-star/SKILL.md` - Fortress integration mapped
- `neural-hub/SKILL.md` - 4-day research cycle defined
- `fortress-architecture/SKILL.md` - already good

### Files Created
- `/CONTEXT_REAL.md` - Grounded truth doc for all Claude instances
- `/REPO_AUDIT_FOR_REPLIT.md` - Audit report to share with Replit
- `/research_cycle_launcher.py` - Template research (needs real GIO)
- `/neural_hub/backend/edge_hunter.py` - Real GIO hunter (needs API key)
- `/research_findings/` - Research output directory
- `/strategies/researched/` - Strategy templates

### Portfolio Updated (Screenshots Verified)
- Ledger: $5,689

## KEY REALIZATIONS

1. **AI is a mirror, not a teacher** - You teach yourself by explaining to me
2. **Infrastructure without understanding = wasted** - Build after you get it
3. **You need cash flow, not systems** - Original goal: extra income
4. **Plans ≠ Reality** - Most code exists but isn't running

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. [ ] Renew Gemini API key (aistudio.google.com)
2. [ ] Fill in CONTEXT_REAL.md blanks (monthly target, P&L, constraints)
3. [ ] Pick ONE thing to understand deeply
4. [ ] Mirror a real trade idea together

## VOICE RESEARCH APP INTEGRATION

**Replit App:** Voice recording → AI transcription → Trading signals → JSON export

**Local Ingest:**
- Google Drive: `SovereignShadow/voice_research_ingest/`
- Local link: `/Volumes/LegacySafe/SS_III/ingest/voice_research_gdrive`
- Processor: `/Volumes/LegacySafe/SS_III/ingest/fetch_voice_research.py`

**Workflow:**
1. Record in Replit Voice App
2. Export JSON to Google Drive `voice_research_ingest/`
3. Run `python3 ingest/fetch_voice_research.py`
4. Research appears in BRAIN.json under `voice_research`

**Export Schema:**
```json
{
  "ticker": "BTC",
  "sentiment": {"overall": "bullish", "confidence": 0.85},
  "signals": [{"type": "entry", "price_target": 42000}],
  "key_insights": ["RSI oversold", "Volume spike"]
}
```

## FILES TO READ ON RESTART

```bash
cat /Volumes/LegacySafe/SS_III/CONTEXT_REAL.md
cat /Volumes/LegacySafe/SS_III/BRAIN.json
```

## COMMUNICATION STANDARD

- No assumptions about what's running
- Plans ≠ executed reality
- Focus on $ generated, not systems built
- Be direct, not whiny
- Ask before leaving
