## Summary
Major architecture decisions and API credential setup for SS_III trading system.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Architecture Finalized
- **SS_III (Local)** = Execution layer, BRAIN.json, trading agents
- **Shadow.AI (Replit)** = Web dashboard, DS-STAR UI, live data display
- **Voice App (Replit)** = Research capture, transcription, signal extraction
- Data flow: Voice App -> JSON -> SS_III -> BRAIN.json -> Agents -> Execute

### 2. Credentials Configured
All API keys loaded into `/Volumes/LegacySafe/SS_III/.env`:
- Coinbase (needs regeneration)
- Kraken
- Binance US
- OKX (needs regeneration)
- Etherscan
- Ledger wallet addresses

### 3. API Connectivity Tested
| Exchange | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Kraken | CONNECTED | PEPE 41,666 / SOL 0.006 / USDG $1.26 |
| Binance US | CONNECTED | USDC $73.16 / PEPE 372 |
| Coinbase | 401 ERROR | Key expired, needs regeneration |
| OKX | KEY NOT FOUND | Key expired, needs regeneration |
| Etherscan | V2 NEEDED | Key valid, endpoint deprecated |
| AAVE | CONFIGURED | Address set, needs Web3 provider |

### 4. NordVPN Dedicated IP Setup
- **IP Address:** 68.165.100.178
- **Location:** United States (Los Angeles)
- **Server:** United States #12152
- **Renewal:** January 15, 2026
- **Purpose:** IP whitelist for exchange API security

### 5. Shadow.AI Clean Export
- Created `/Volumes/LegacySafe/Shadow_AI_CLEAN.zip` (21MB)
- Removed bloat: temp uploads, logs, node_modules, .git
- Ready for Replit upload or Gemini ingestion

---

## Files Modified
- `/Volumes/LegacySafe/SS_III/.env` - All credentials loaded
- `/Volumes/LegacySafe/SS_III/.coinbase_key.pem` - PEM file for Coinbase
- `/Volumes/LegacySafe/SS_III/BRAIN.json` - Updated to v3.1

## Files Created
- `/Volumes/LegacySafe/Shadow_AI_CLEAN.zip` - Clean export (21MB)

---

## Next Steps
1. Connect to NordVPN dedicated IP (68.165.100.178)
2. Generate new Coinbase API key with IP + address whitelist
3. Test Coinbase connectivity
4. Regenerate OKX API key
5. Build Voice App on Replit
6. Build SS_III ingest layer for Voice App exports

---

## Key Decisions
- Execution stays LOCAL (SS_III) for control and security
- Replit for dashboards and research capture only
- US-based VPN IP to maintain legal exchange access
- Withdrawal address whitelist for security (Ledger only)

---

## Live Capital Available
- Binance US: $73.16 USDC
- Kraken: ~$1.26
- Coinbase: $519.95 (pending API fix)

**Total Tradeable:** ~$594 (once Coinbase fixed)
