# Session: 2025-12-28 (FINAL)

## Accomplishments

### MoonDev Integration
- Wired 3 verified strategies (MomentumBreakout +12.5%, BandedMACD +6.9%, VolCliffArbitrage 75% WR)
- Multi-exchange OHLCV fallback: Binance.US → Kraken → Coinbase
- Created symlink to MoonDev src for full agent functionality

### Outrageous Filter System
- Created `config/outrageous_signals.py` with tiered execution:
  - OUTRAGEOUS (85%+): Full size, auto-execute
  - STRONG (70-84%): 75% size, auto-execute
  - MODERATE (55-69%): 50% size, auto-execute
  - WEAK (<55%): Log only, wait
- Balanced approach: not too restrictive, won't miss opportunities

### Overnight Service
- Created `bin/overnight_service.sh` for 24/7 background monitoring
- Commands: start, stop, status, logs, cycle
- Service running in PAPER mode, scanning every 15 minutes

### Agent Council
- All 7 agents loaded successfully:
  - ReflectAgent, WhaleAgent, SwarmAgent, FundingArbAgent
  - LiquidationAgent, RiskAgent, PortfolioAgent
- Fixed SHADE agent import issues (try/except for relative imports)

## Trades/Positions
- No trades executed (paper mode, all signals WAIT)
- Market regime: Low Volatility Trend (SHORT bias)
- Max confidence: 50% (below all thresholds)

## Key Decisions
- Philosophy: "I don't want to trade. I want the trade to find me."
- Tiered execution instead of single 90% threshold
- Paper mode for overnight, alerts on for STRONG+ signals

## System State at EOD
```
Service: RUNNING (PID 93636)
Mode: PAPER
Interval: 15 minutes
Monitoring: BTC, ETH, SOL, ENA, PENDLE, LDO + 20 others
All signals: WAIT (market ranging)
```

## Next Steps
- Monitor overnight results in `data/overnight_results/`
- Review any STRONG+ alerts via NTFY
- Graduate to live execution when confident in signal quality
- Consider adding more MoonDev strategies as they're verified

## Commit
```
a39f253 MoonDev signals + tiered execution + overnight service
