## Summary
Full system audit of SS_III codebase. Fixed critical Gemini API issue. Clarified system focus (RWA, not Outrageous Filter).

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Complete Codebase Audit
- Read all major directories: core/, bin/, docs/, data/, memory/, ds_star/, doe_engine/
- Mapped 12 core modules, 5 swarm agents, 7 council agents
- Identified working vs broken components

### 2. Fixed Gemini API Issue
- **Problem:** Local `.env` Gemini key expired + Replit's AI Integrations Gemini key also expired
- **Solution:** Created `core/ai/smart_ai.py` - Self-healing AI router
  - Tests all providers on startup
  - Auto-fallback: Anthropic → OpenAI → Gemini
  - Caches working provider for 1 hour
  - NTFY alert if ALL providers down
- **Result:** Anthropic (claude-haiku-4-5) and OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) working via Replit

### 3. Created Replit AI Proxy
- `core/ai/replit_proxy.py` - Routes AI calls through Replit's managed keys
- No new Google API key needed

### 4. Pushed Session Summary to Replit
- `/api/brain/push` endpoint updated with session findings

## Critical Correction: System Focus

**What I was incorrectly focusing on:**
- Outrageous Filter (score-based trade filtering)
- AAVE debt management
- Cold storage siphon automation

**What the system is ACTUALLY about:**
- **RWA (Real World Asset) Tokenization** - $36B market, 1000x growth since 2019
- **MANUS Research Reports** - GIO (Gemini) analysis output
- **Core Positions:** LINK (cornerstone), INJ, QNT, ONDO, PLUME

**The Thesis:**
> Own the infrastructure (LINK = Swift integration, 11,500 banks) + first movers (ONDO, MAPLE)

## RWA Research Located

Found existing research in `docs/manus_research/`:
- `RWA_GAMEPLAN_2025.md` - Position sizing, entry strategy, milestones
- `GIO_FINAL_RWA_INTELLIGENCE_REPORT_2025-12-23.md` - LINK/INJ/QNT/PLUME verdicts
- `GIO_RWA_DEEP_ANALYSIS_2025-12-23.md`
- `GIO_FORESIGHT_RWA_CROSSREF_2025-12-23.md`
- `GIO_MACHINE_ECONOMY_THESIS_2025-12-23.md`

**RWA Alerts Already Built:** `bin/rwa_alerts.py` monitors LINK, ONDO, INJ, QNT entry zones

## Issues Found

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Gemini API expired | FIXED | SmartAI auto-fallback to Anthropic/OpenAI |
| neural_signals.json broken | FIXED | Was calling expired Gemini |
| GitHub push failing | UNFIXED | Token auth error - needs fresh token |
| Morning RWA research lost | LOST | Context compaction before session save |

---

## Files Created

1. `core/ai/smart_ai.py` - Self-healing multi-provider AI router
2. `core/ai/replit_proxy.py` - Replit API wrapper for AI calls
3. `data/ai_provider_cache.json` - Working provider cache

---

## Working APIs (via Replit)

| Provider | Model | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Anthropic | claude-haiku-4-5 | ✅ Working |
| OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | ✅ Working |
| Gemini | gemini-2.5-flash | ❌ Key expired |

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Start RWA alerts: `python3 bin/rwa_alerts.py`
2. [ ] Fix GitHub token for push access
3. [ ] Recreate lost morning RWA research
4. [ ] Integrate SmartAI into overnight_runner.py
5. [ ] Review LINK entry zone ($18-22)

---

## Key Insight

> "The system philosophy is NOT about automating trades. It's about RWA thesis execution: own the rails (LINK), accumulate first movers (ONDO, INJ), and let MANUS research guide entries."
