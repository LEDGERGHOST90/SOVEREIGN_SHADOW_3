## 📈 RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### AAVE Monitoring (Automated)
```python
# Trigger alerts when:
HF < 3.0  → Yellow Alert (Review position)
HF < 2.5  → Orange Alert (Add collateral)
HF < 2.0  → Red Alert (Emergency repay)
HF < 1.5  → Critical Alert (Immediate action)
```

### Exchange Safety (Manual Oversight)
```python
# Safety rules:
max_position_size = $250  # 25% of $1,000
max_daily_trades = 3
max_daily_loss = $50
stop_loss_percent = 5%
```

### Cold Storage Protection (Locked)
```
BTC Cold Storage: $2,231.74
├── Status: LOCKED
├── Access: Emergency only
└── Usage: AAVE repay ($351) + portfolio rebalancing
```
