# 🎯 THREE-BUCKET WEALTH MACHINE - BATTLE PLAN
### Integration with Sovereign Legacy Loop

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Goal**: Transform Sovereign Legacy Loop from a trading platform into a **complete wealth management ecosystem** with automated profit distribution across three buckets:
- **Vault Growth (30%)**: Long-term cold storage wealth
- **Engine Fuel (55%)**: Hot capital for trading/flips
- **Wage/Lifestyle (15%)**: Regular cashflow payouts

**Key Principle**: This is an **ADDITION**, not a replacement. All existing features remain intact and enhanced.
