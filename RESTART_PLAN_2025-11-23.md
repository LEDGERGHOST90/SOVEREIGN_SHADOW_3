## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: AAVE POSITION

Your AAVE position is 53% of your portfolio. This is in a DeFi lending protocol.

**Current AAVE Details:**
- Collateral: $3,330.54 worth of stETH
- Debt: $658.82 (USDC + USDtb)
- Net Value: $2,671.73
- Health Factor: 4.09 ✅ (safe, but locked)
- APY: 6.0%

**THE PROBLEM:**
- Your AAVE tokens in Ledger ($2,842) might be different from your AAVE position
- Need to verify: Is this AAVE tokens OR staked ETH in AAVE?
- If it's stETH locked in AAVE, you can't easily sell it without repaying debt

**ACTION NEEDED:**
1. Check AAVE app: https://app.aave.com/
2. Verify what "AETHWSTETH" actually is
3. Determine if you can withdraw or if you need to repay debt first

## 🎯 TARGET ALLOCATION (Core 4)

| ETH   | 30%      | $1,644   | $14       | +$1,630    |
| SOL   | 20%      | $1,096   | $1        | +$1,095    |
| XRP   | 10%      | $548     | $1,030    | -$482      |

## 📋 REBALANCING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: VERIFY AAVE (DO THIS FIRST)
- [ ] Connect to https://app.aave.com/
- [ ] Check if you have an open borrow position
- [ ] Identify what AETHWSTETH is (likely Aave Ethereum stETH)
- [ ] Determine exit strategy for AAVE position

### Phase 2: LIQUIDITY PLAN

**Option A: If AAVE is liquid (can withdraw easily)**
1. Withdraw some AAVE to USDC (~$2,000)
2. Use to buy ETH and SOL
3. Rebalance to target

**Option B: If AAVE is locked (has debt)**
1. Repay $658.82 debt using your $1,030 XRP
2. Withdraw collateral
3. Rebalance everything to target

**Option C: Leave AAVE earning 6% APY**
1. Keep AAVE position (it's safe and earning)
2. Use your XRP + small BTC sell to fund ETH/SOL buys
3. Accept you're overweight AAVE for now

### Phase 3: EXECUTE REBALANCING

**Recommended Steps** (after Phase 1 verification):
1. **Sell**: 482 XRP → USDC ($482)
2. **Sell**: 0.008 BTC → USDC ($754)
3. **Buy**: $1,630 worth of ETH
4. **Buy**: $1,095 worth of SOL
5. **Result**: Proper 40/30/20/10 allocation

## 🛡️ NEW TRADING RULES (MANDATORY)

### NEVER AGAIN:
1. ❌ Trade without checking portfolio allocation first
2. ❌ Hold positions that are >30% of portfolio (except strategic like AAVE)
3. ❌ Make emotional trades when down
4. ❌ Trade without recording in trade journal

### ALWAYS:
1. ✅ Check allocation BEFORE every trade
2. ✅ Use stop losses (max 2% loss per trade)
3. ✅ Journal every trade with reason
4. ✅ Review portfolio weekly
5. ✅ Keep 80%+ in Core 4 (BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP)
6. ✅ Max 20% for speculative plays

### CAPITAL PRESERVATION MODE:
- No trades over $500 without preflight check
- No leverage, no margin, no futures
- No coins outside top 50 by market cap
- Max 5% portfolio in any single altcoin (except Core 4)
- Stop trading if you lose 10% in a week

## 💭 MEMPHIS - READ THIS

You're not "losing your ass." You withdrew money for personal needs. That's life.

What you have left ($5,481) is REAL money that can grow back to $7,855 and beyond.

But ONLY if you:
1. Follow the system
2. Stop emotional trading
3. Stick to Core 4
4. Use proper risk management

The AAVE position is actually GOOD - it's earning 6% APY and is safe. Don't panic about it.

Focus on what you can control:
- Proper allocation
- Disciplined entries
- No overleveraging
- Patience

You built this entire system. Now USE it.

**Next Action**: Check AAVE and report back. Then we rebalance properly.
