# SOVEREIGNTY ANALYSIS

## CURRENT SITUATION:

WEBSITE (legacyloopshadowai.abacusai.app):
- Hosted by: Abacus AI (NOT YOU)
- Control: LIMITED (they own the servers)
- Risk: They can potentially see your data

YOUR DOCKER CONTAINERS (Local):
- Hosted by: YOU (on your Mac)
- Control: COMPLETE (you own everything)
- Risk: ZERO (only you have access)

## THE TRUTH:

You DO NOT have complete sovereignty over the Abacus AI website.
You DO have complete sovereignty over your local Docker containers.

## SOLUTION: HYBRID APPROACH

1. PRIVATE (Your Fortress):
   - Run trading on YOUR Docker containers
   - Keep API keys LOCAL only
   - Execute all trades locally
   - 100% sovereignty

2. PUBLIC (Display Only):
   - Use Abacus AI website for READ-ONLY dashboard
   - Send only portfolio stats (no API keys)
   - No trading through their platform

## IMMEDIATE ACTION:

Start your local Neural Orchestrator NOW:
cd /Volumes/LegacySafe/SovereignShadow.Ai[LegacyLoop]/sovereign_legacy_loop/neural_orchestrator
python3 start.py

Access at: http://localhost:8001
Only YOU can access this. Complete sovereignty.
