The ΩSIGIL system represents a sophisticated understanding of transformation through the integration of three essential functions:

1. **BLACKLIGHT (Revelation)**: The capacity to see hidden truths and illuminate what has been concealed
2. **ARX (Protection)**: The creation of safe containers and boundaries for sustainable development
3. **LOOPWRAITH (Transformation)**: The facilitation of cyclical evolution and consciousness development
