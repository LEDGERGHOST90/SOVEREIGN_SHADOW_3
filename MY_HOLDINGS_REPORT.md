### Key Observations

1. **AETHWSTETH is 52.75%** - This is your largest position and it's earning yield. This is GOOD - you're getting passive income.

2. **BTC is 26.74%** - Below your 40% target. You'd need ~$708 more BTC to hit target.

3. **XRP is 19.11%** - Above your 10% target. You could sell ~$485 worth to rebalance.

4. **ETH is only 0.25%** - But remember, most of your ETH is staked as AETHWSTETH (52.75%), so you actually have significant ETH exposure.

5. **SOL is 0%** - You have no Solana, but target is 20%. Would need ~$1,062 to reach target.

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option 1: Keep Current Allocation (RECOMMENDED)
- ✅ Your AETHWSTETH is earning yield (passive income)
- ✅ AAVE position is healthy (4.09 health factor)
- ✅ No urgent rebalancing needed
- ✅ Let positions grow naturally

### Option 2: Rebalance to Targets (IF DESIRED)
If you want to match your target allocation:

1. **Sell some XRP:** ~$485 worth (to get from 19% to 10%)
2. **Buy more BTC:** ~$708 worth (to get from 27% to 40%)
3. **Buy SOL:** ~$1,062 worth (to reach 20% target)

**Total rebalancing cost:** ~$2,255

**OR** wait for natural growth and rebalance gradually.
