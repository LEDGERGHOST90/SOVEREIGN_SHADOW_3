2. Sniping      - ⚠️ NEEDS CODE (new listings, $200 max)
3. Scalping     - ⚠️ NEEDS CODE (2% movements, 20-50/day)
4. Laddering    - ⚠️ NEEDS CODE (10 rungs, accumulation)

## 🔑 KEY CONCEPTS TO REMEMBER

### 1. The Hierarchy (CRITICAL)
```
SOVEREIGN LEGACY LOOP (Master)
    ├── Empire (subordinate component)
    ├── Trading Systems
    ├── Claude SDK
    └── Neural Consciousness
```
**NOT:** Empire → Legacy Loop  
**YES:** Legacy Loop → Empire

### 2. Capital Structure (MEMORIZE)
- **$6,600 Ledger = NEVER TRADES** (cold storage forever)
- **$1,660 Coinbase = YOUR ONLY TRADING CAPITAL**
- Max per trade = $415 (25%)

### 3. Minimum Arbitrage Spread
- **NOT:** 0.125% (too small after fees)
- **YES:** 2.5%+ (profitable after fees)

### 4. The 3 Layers
```
Layer 1: Consciousness (You)
Layer 2: Intelligence (Neural Consciousness - Abacus AI)
Layer 3: Execution (Sovereign Legacy Loop - MacBook)
```

### 5. Security Rule #1
**NEVER** trade with the Ledger $6,600. Ever. Period.
