Stablecoin-as-a-Service 
As more institutions turn to on-chain settlement, a new category of infrastructure providers – “Stablecoin-as-a-Service” – has emerged to help corporates launch and manage regulated tokens. 

Investors have taken note.  

VC investment in stablecoin-related companies totaled less than $50 million in 2019; this year, it exceeded $1.5 billion, flowing to firms such as Tempo and MeshConnect that enable enterprise adoption.

Looking ahead, digital dollarization is poised to reshape financial plumbing. Corporates increasingly treat tokenized dollars as 24/7 liquid cash, stablecoin issuers are becoming significant buyers of T-bills, and ETF and custody approvals are nudging banks toward deeper integration of on-chain dollars into core financial systems. In 2026, we expect on-chain dollars to graduate from pilots into enterprise plumbing – inside treasury workflows, cross-border settlement and programmable B2B payments. 

4: Real world asset tokenization goes mainstream

Tokenization is moving from pilot experiments to production-scale financial infrastructure. In 2025, on-chain representations of cash, treasuries and money market instruments crossed $36 billion, calculating supply across public and permissioned blockchains, according to RWA.xyz. This momentum is carrying RWAs (real world assets) into the financial mainstream. 


In crypto, real-world assets (RWAs) are conventional financial assets – stocks, bonds and real estate – issued as blockchain tokens that represent ownership rights to the underlying assets. Tokenization lets managers fractionalize ownership more easily, increasing liquidity and enabling more efficient administration of the asset. A token might represent a small portion of a commercial building or a corporate bond.  

This is bringing Ethereum and Solana to Wall Street. RWAs are increasingly seen as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance. As BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein wrote in an opinion piece for The Economist in December 2025, tokenization will help merge digital-first innovators with traditional institutions. “In the future, people won’t keep stocks and bonds in one portfolio and crypto in another,” they wrote. “Assets of all kinds could one day be bought, sold, and held through a single digital wallet.”  

Tokens and T-bills 
Tokenized T-Bills and short-duration T-bills now power emerging on-chain money markets repo markets, and programmable cash-management tools for funds and corporations.  

BlackRock’s USED Institutional Digital Liquidity fund (BUIDL) surpassed $500 million just months after launching.  
Franklin Templeton’s tokenized funds have scaled past $400 million.  

Money market funds are increasingly settling redemptions, subscriptions and collateral flows directly on chain. If tokenized T-bills show what tokenization looks like for institutions, prediction markets show what it looks like for consumers.  

Tokenization expands beyond treasury 

ETF issuers and fund managers are also testing on-chain wrappers to reduce transfer costs and enable intraday settlements. WisdomTree, 21Shares and Hashnote are all running tokenized fund pilots.  

In addition, crypto-native RWAs are expanding, most visibly in prediction markets, where on-chain tokens represent real-world outcomes and settle automatically.  

Polymarket reached $3.7 billion in monthly trading volume in November 2025 and was reportedly valued at $8 billion, the highest value for a crypto-native consumer app since OpenSea (excluding exchanges and wallets).  
In parallel, prediction market Kalshi reached a reported $11 billion valuation in December 2025.

Equity markets 

Even equity markets are experimenting with tokenization. Robinhood, Figure and Securitize have explored tokenized company stocks. Robinhood has launched tokenized security trading for European users. The offering allows traders to buy and sell tokenized contract that track stocks and ETFs over Arbitrum. It plans to expand this offering to US markets, including tokenized secondary trading for still-private companies.  

While these plans will face additional regulatory scrutiny, the efforts signal a future where private and public markets converge on the same settlement networks. Similarly on the crypto-native side, Coinbase’s Echo platform – acquired for $375 million in October 2025, per company disclosures – allows startups to raise capital through token sales.  

While these plans will face additional regulatory scrutiny, the efforts signal a future where private and public markets converge on the same settlement networks.  

In 2026, we expect tokenization to expand beyond T-bills into tokenized funds, private markets and consumer-grade applications, bringing distribution and compliance, not just issuance, on chain.  

5: AI and crypto redefine digital commerce

AI and crypto are converging to create a new layer of digital commerce: autonomous agents that transact, verify and coordinate economic activity without human involvement.  

AI wallets that are capable of self-managing digital assets are now moving from prototypes to pilot programs.  
VC-backed companies are increasingly merging AI and crypto technology. For every VC dollar invested into crypto companies in 2025, 40 cents went to a company also building AI products, a jump from just 18 cents last year.  
Startups like Ritual, Fetch.AI and Grass are building agent-to-agent commerce protocols while Coinbase, Solana and Polygon are working on integrating AI inference into crypto wallets.

Solving AI’s trust problem 

While these integrations are building a truly crypto-native economy, blockchain is also helping to solve one of AI’s fundamental problems: trust.  

Blockchain provenance protocols can help verify AI content, trace model outputs and enforce copyright and ownership claims.  
Crypto projects like Worldcoin and Provenance Labs are being applied to enterprises to sniff out deepfakes and other synthetic content.  
Adobe’s Content Authenticity Initiative is creating a toolset that adds credentials to content containing a record of its creation and edit history.   

A second act for DePIN 

Meanwhile, AI is helping to give DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) a second act.  

Networks such as Akash and io.net are attracting AI compute workloads as miners shift from token incentives to actual revenue. Enterprise cloud buyers are tapping these networks for compute overflow capacity, edge computing and distributed storage.  

The next wave of consumer crypto apps emerges at this intersection – fast, invisible and capable of performing transactions autonomously. In 2026, the breakout consumer apps won’t market themselves as ‘crypto’, they’ll feel like modern fintech, with agents, stablecoin settlement and provenance running quietly under the hood. 

In 2026 and beyond

Our predictions represent just a few of the many promising areas in crypto today. The UX for consumer applications is massively improving, the promise of blockchain for identify verification is reaching wider understanding and tokenized gaming remains an important, and growing, on-ramp for crypto users. Regardless of how tangible or visible, all the forces shaping crypto today share a common thread: crypto is moving from expectations to production. Pilot programs are scaling, and capital is consolidating.  

Treat crypto as infrastructure in 2026. Build or partner now around stablecoin settlement, custody/compliance rails and tokenized-asset distribution. The winners will be the platforms that make these capabilities invisible, regulated and usable at scale.   

For end-users, the result will be a more seamless experience across everyday financial interactions, from sending cross-border payments to managing an investment portfolio. We’re optimistic about that future and about the role that technology will play in delivering it.
