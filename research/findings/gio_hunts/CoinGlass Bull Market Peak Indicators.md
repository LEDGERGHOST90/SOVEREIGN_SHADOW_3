## Key Observations

**Near-Peak Indicators (>90% progress):**
1. Long Term Holder Supply: 95.82% - LTH distribution nearly complete
2. Short Term Holder Supply: 98.14% - STH accumulation nearly at peak threshold
3. Bitcoin Dominance: 91.07% - Close to historical peak dominance

**Mid-Cycle Indicators (40-60%):**
- MVRV Ratio: 52%
- RSI 22-Day: 52.03%
- NUPL: 50.72%
- CBBI: 58.89%

**Early-Cycle Indicators (<30%):**
- Ahr999 Index: 13%
- MVRV Z-Score: 21.4%
- 2-Year MA Multiplier: 20.93%
- RHODL Ratio: 17.25%

## Interpretation
The market is in a **mid-cycle correction phase** with no peak signals triggered. The average 43.46% progress suggests significant upside potential remains before typical cycle top conditions are met. However, the near-complete LTH distribution (95.82%) and high BTC dominance (91.07%) warrant monitoring as potential early warning signs.
