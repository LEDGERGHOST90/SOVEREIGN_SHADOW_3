## Key Framework: Four-Year Cycle Analysis

Grayscale identifies four distinct historical Bitcoin cycles with the following characteristics:

| Cycle | Duration | Return Multiple | Start | Peak |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------|------|
| Cycle 1 | ~1 year | >500x | Early history | - |
| Cycle 2 | ~2 years | >500x | - | - |
| Cycle 3 | ~3 years | >100x | Jan 2015 | Dec 2017 |
| Cycle 4 | ~3 years | ~20x | Dec 2018 | Nov 2021 |
| Current | 2+ years | ~6x | Nov 2022 ($16k) | Ongoing |

## On-Chain Cycle Indicators (as of May 2024)

**MVRV Ratio (Market Value / Realized Value):**
- Historical cycle peak threshold: ≥4
- Current reading: 2.6
- Interpretation: Intermediate stage, room to run

**HODL Waves (1-year active supply / free float):**
- Historical cycle peak threshold: ≥60%
- Current reading: ~54%
- Interpretation: More coin turnover expected before peak

**MCTC Ratio (Miner Cap / Thermocap):**
- Historical cycle peak threshold: ≥10
- Current reading: ~6
- Interpretation: Intermediate stage

**Bitcoin Dominance Pattern:**
- Historically peaks ~2 years into bull market
- Has begun declining (typical of third year of cycle)

## Altcoin Market Indicators

**Funding Rates:**
- Meaningfully positive but below cycle highs
- Indicates moderate speculative length

**Perpetual Futures Open Interest (Altcoins):**
- Reached ~$54B before Dec 9 liquidation event
- Declined ~$10B after liquidations but remains elevated
- High OI can indicate later stages of cycle

## Key Conclusions

1. Current indicators consistent with INTERMEDIATE stage of cycle
2. Bull market can potentially extend into 2025 and beyond if supported by fundamentals
3. ETF approval ($36.7B net inflows) represents structural change
4. Four-year cycle pattern may reshape as market matures
5. Bitcoin's ~6x return this cycle is significantly less than prior cycles (diminishing returns pattern)
