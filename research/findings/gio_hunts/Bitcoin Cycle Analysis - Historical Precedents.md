### Historical Bitcoin Halving Cycles

| Halving Year | Starting Price | Peak Price | Correction |
|--------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| 2012 | $12 | $1,150 | -85% |
| 2016 | $650 | $20,000 | -80% |
| 2020 | $8,700 | $69,000 | -75% |
| 2024 | ~$60,000 | $124,752 (Oct 2025 ATH) | Ongoing |

### Key Structural Changes

**Market Structure Evolution:**
- Bitcoin no longer dominated by retail speculation
- US spot ETFs (launched Jan 2024) opened access to regulated, long-term capital
- Pension funds, asset managers, corporate treasuries now participating
- Institutional investors hold through volatility rather than react to headlines
- First time Bitcoin hit ATH *before* a halving event

**Supply Dynamics:**
- 2024 halving reduced supply growth from ~1.7% to 0.85%
- Nearly 94% of total Bitcoin already mined
- Supply effect now marginal compared to earlier halvings

**Macro Factors Now Dominant:**
- Bitcoin fell with equities during 2022 rate-hike cycle
- Rallied as global liquidity improved 2023-2025
- Now trades like macro asset sensitive to:
  - Real yields
  - Liquidity flows
  - Risk appetite

### Current Cycle Status (as of Nov 2025)
- Bitcoin above $110,000 with subdued volatility
- Monthly RSI indicates controlled rather than euphoric growth
- Usual "blow-off top" pattern missing
- Post-halving gains of ~18% (slower than historical)
- Peak potentially extending into 2026

### Analyst Thesis
Some analysts argue Bitcoin's four-year cycle is stretching to five as:
1. Liquidity waves lengthen
2. Institutional participation deepens
3. Macro dynamics override halving effects

The familiar boom-and-bust pattern may be giving way to steadier growth, institutional maturity, and global macro trends rather than retail euphoria.
