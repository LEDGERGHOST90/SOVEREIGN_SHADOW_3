### Event Summary
On October 10, 2025, more than **$19 billion** of crypto leverage was liquidated in roughly a day, triggering a "tail risk" event that marked the start of a broader sell-off continuing into December.

### Trigger Factors
The crash followed a 100% China tariff threat hitting global risk assets. Three factors transformed this into a crisis:

1. **How risk was positioned** - Elevated BTC and ETH perpetual futures open interest
2. **How it was funded** - Funding rates climbed from ~10% to ~30% annualized by Oct 6
3. **Leverage and infrastructure interaction** - Unified (cross-asset) margin concentrated exposure

### Liquidity Failure Mechanics
- BTC top-of-book depth shrank by **>90%** on key venues
- Bid-ask spreads widened from single-digit basis points to **double-digit percentages**
- Market makers widened spreads dramatically or stepped away entirely
- Crypto books operating with **20-50x leverage** faced existential risk when liquidity disappeared

### Stablecoin De-peg Event
USDe (delta-neutral stablecoin) traded at **mid-$0.60s on Binance** (~35% discount) while staying near $1 on other exchanges. This was caused by:
- Venue-specific oracle pricing
- Margin engines using local spot prices
- Positions liquidated based on single-venue pricing

### Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) Risk
- Exchanges forcibly closed profitable positions to plug deficits
- Best-hedged shorts found positions reduced or closed
- Creates second layer of risk beyond trade economics

### Market Impact (as of Dec 2025)
- BTC declined **~30%** from October ATH
- Open interest down **>40%** from October highs
- Bitcoin ETFs experienced significant outflows
- Funding levels normalized
- Several venues tightened leverage caps

### Structural Vulnerabilities vs Traditional Markets
Traditional markets have:
- Circuit breakers
- Central counterparties with conservative margin
- Strict retail leverage limits

Crypto lacks:
- Consistent safety rails
- Centralized risk management
- Uniform leverage limits
- Coordinated price discovery

### Key Risk Lessons
1. Headline leverage is only starting point - effective leverage depends on collateral behavior under stress
2. Model executable size, not just spreads
3. Build scenarios where market depth shrinks 90%
4. Single venue concentration = single point of failure
5. Multi-venue oracles with outlier controls should be standard

## 2025 Crypto Liquidation Crisis Summary

**Source:** CoinGlass data (via CryptoSlate)
**Total 2025 Liquidations:** ~$150-154.6 billion

### Key Risk Factors for 2026

1. **Leverage Risk**
   - High leverage (20-50x) remains available
   - Unified margin creates correlated liquidation risk
   - ADL mechanisms can unwind hedged positions

2. **Liquidity Risk**
   - Market depth can evaporate 90%+ during stress
   - Fragmented price discovery across exchanges
   - Market makers may withdraw during volatility

3. **Infrastructure Risk**
   - Exchange interfaces can freeze during stress
   - Oracle pricing inconsistencies
   - Venue-specific collateral valuation

4. **Macro Risk**
   - Fed policy sensitivity
   - Global liquidity correlation
   - Geopolitical events (tariffs, sanctions)
   - Risk asset correlation increasing

5. **Regulatory Risk**
   - Stablecoin regulation (GENIUS Act implementation)
   - Potential emerging market currency destabilization
   - Cross-border regulatory divergence

6. **Concentration Risk**
   - ETF flows concentrated in few products
   - Corporate treasury holdings concentrated
   - Mining centralization concerns
