- Historical bottoms (2018, 2020, 2022): sub-1.0
- Interpretation: Cooled but not in deep value zone

### SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio)

## Competing Interpretations

### Bear Cycle Thesis (CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju)
- "Most Bitcoin on-chain indicators are bearish"
- "Without macro liquidity, we enter a bear cycle"
- Metrics compare to Q1 2022

### Deep Correction Thesis
- MVRV Z-Score not in oversold territory
- Bitcoin has not broken aggregate realized price ($50-55k)
- Leverage flush creates cleaner setup for rally

### Bull Reset Thesis (Glassnode, Trakx)
- Late November drop to low-$80,000s = "2025's strongest BTC buy zone"
- "Normal bull cycle pullback, not new bear market"
- If global liquidity rises, bull trend intact

## Critical Variable: Global Liquidity
- Sahm Capital: Global net liquidity falling for years under inflation/rate hikes/QT
- I/O Fund: Global liquidity stalling, "setting up for reversal"
- Bitwise: Global liquidity growth "remains robust"
- Glassnode/Fasanara: Bitcoin retraced as global liquidity tightens

## Verdict from Article
"Bitcoin is at an inflection point, not a confirmed top. The on-chain indicators are flashing yellow, not red."
