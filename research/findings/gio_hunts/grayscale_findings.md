# Grayscale Research Findings - Crypto Cycle Analysis

**Source:** Grayscale Research - "The State of the Crypto Cycle"
**Authors:** Zach Pandl, Michael Zhao
**Last Updated:** 5/29/2024 (with December 2024 data)

## Key Quantitative Indicators

### MVRV Ratio (Market Value to Realized Value)
- **Current Level:** 2.6
- **Historical Peak Threshold:** 4.0+ in past cycles
- **Interpretation:** Intermediate stage - below historical peak levels

### Bitcoin Cycle Performance
- Current cycle started November 2022 (cyclical low ~$16k)
- Duration: Just over 2 years
- Return: ~6x from cyclical low
- Historical comparison: Past two cycles lasted ~3 years before peaking

### MCTC Ratio (Miner Cap to Thermocap)
- **Current Level:** ~6
- **Historical Peak Threshold:** 10+
- **Interpretation:** Intermediate stage

### Bitcoin Free Float Activity
- **Current Level:** ~54% of free float supply transacted in last year
- **Historical Peak Threshold:** 60%+
- **Interpretation:** More coin movement expected before cycle peak

### Altcoin Perpetual Futures Open Interest
- **Pre-December 9 liquidation:** ~$54 billion
- **Post-liquidation:** Declined by ~$10 billion but remains elevated
- **Interpretation:** High speculative positioning - potential late-cycle indicator

### Funding Rates (Altcoins)
- Meaningfully positive but below earlier 2024 highs
- Below highs of last cycle
- **Interpretation:** Intermediate speculative length

## Key Findings

1. **Four-Year Cycle Pattern:** Crypto valuations have historically followed ~4-year cycles tied to halving events

2. **Current Regime Assessment:** Grayscale sees indicators consistent with "intermediate stage" of cycle

3. **Bitcoin Dominance:** Has begun to fall around 2-year mark (consistent with past cycles)

4. **ETF Inflows:** $36.7 billion net capital inflows into spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs (as of Dec 11, 2024)

5. **Bull Market Outlook:** Could extend into 2025+ if supported by fundamentals (application adoption, macro conditions)

# Grayscale 2026 Digital Asset Outlook

**Source:** Grayscale Research Team
**Date:** December 15, 2025

## Key Thesis: End of the Four-Year Cycle

Grayscale argues that **2026 will mark the end of the "four-year cycle"** theory in crypto markets. Their key points:

1. **Rising valuations expected in 2026** across all six Crypto Sectors
2. **Bitcoin price could exceed previous ATH in H1 2026**
3. Current bull market has lasted >3 years; most recent halving was April 2024 (>1.5 years ago)

## Two Pillars of Optimism

### 1. Macro Demand for Alternative Stores of Value
- U.S. debt problem raises doubts about low inflation credibility
- Bitcoin and Ether as scarce digital commodities
- Fiat currency debasement risk driving portfolio demand

### 2. Regulatory Clarity Driving Institutional Investment
- 2023: Grayscale won SEC lawsuit (paved way for ETPs)
- 2024: Bitcoin and Ether spot ETPs launched
- 2025: GENIUS Act passed on stablecoins
- 2026 Expected: Bipartisan crypto market structure legislation

## Key Statistics

- **Global crypto ETP inflows since Jan 2024:** $87 billion
- **U.S. advised wealth allocated to crypto:** <0.5%
- **Maximum YoY BTC price increase this cycle:** ~240% (to March 2024)
- **Prior cycles:** >1,000% YoY increases
- **20 millionth Bitcoin mining:** Expected March 2026

## Cycle Comparison

| Metric | Prior Cycles | Current Cycle |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Max YoY Price Increase | >1,000% | ~240% |
| Capital Source | Retail momentum | Institutional steady buying |
| Fed Policy at Peak | Rate hikes | Rate cuts expected |
| Drawdown Risk | High | Relatively low (per Grayscale) |

## Top 10 Crypto Investing Themes for 2026

1. Dollar Debasement Risk → BTC, ETH, ZEC
2. Regulatory Clarity → Almost all crypto assets
3. Stablecoin Growth (GENIUS Act)
4. Asset Tokenization at Inflection Point
5. Privacy Solutions Needed → ZEC
6. AI Centralization Calls for Blockchain Solutions
7. DeFi Accelerates, Led by Lending
8. Next-Generation Infrastructure Adoption
9. Focus on Sustainable Revenue
10. Staking by Default

## Topics NOT Expected to Impact Markets in 2026
- Quantum computing (preparedness continues but no valuation impact)
- Digital Asset Treasuries (not a major swing factor)

# Tiger Research: 10 Crypto Market Shifts for 2026

**Source:** Tiger Research
**Authors:** Daniel Kim, Ryan Yoon, Jay Jo, Ekko An
**Date:** December 26, 2025

## Key Thesis
The crypto industry is joining the mainstream. Institutions have become key market players. Capital moves to projects that generate real revenue. Short-term price fluctuations no longer matter. Sustainable business models have become essential.

## 10 Major Shifts Forecast

### 1. Institutional Capital Stays in Bitcoin
- Institutions avoid unproven assets
- Scope limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum
- Market growth concentrates on assets meeting institutional standards

### 2. Revenue-Driven Projects Survive
- 85% of new tokens drop post-TGE
- Hype-based projects replaced by fundamentals
- Market shifts toward real revenue generation

### 3. Tokenomics Evolution
- Utility-focused tokenomics failed
- Governance voting rights didn't attract investors
- Direct returns through buybacks/burns will survive
- Protocol growth must immediately impact token price

### 4. M&A Acceleration
- Web3 maturing, competition intensifying
- M&A fastest way to scale
- Winners drive aggressive M&A activity

### 5. Robotics Data Economy
- Blockchain-based decentralized crowdsourcing for robot training data
- New gig economy centered on robotics

### 6. Media + Prediction Markets
- Media firms adopt prediction markets
- Readers transition from passive to active participation

### 7. RWA Market Consolidation
- Traditional financial institutions building own chains
- Third-party RWA platforms lose competitive edge

### 8. BTCFi Growth
- ETH stake ETFs push BTC holders to seek yield
- BTCFi fills the gap
- Large funds entering BTC need asset utility

### 9. Fintech App Dominance
- Fintech apps become top choice for crypto trade
- New users don't need crypto exchanges
- Growth led by fintech tools

### 10. Privacy Tech for Institutions
- Chain transparency reveals trade plans (weakness for large firms)
- Privacy tech vital for institutional participation
- Big capital flows only if trade data is secure

# DL News: Four Factors Driving Bitcoin Price into 2026

**Source:** DL News (London Crypto Club - David Brickell & Chris Mills)
**Date:** December 24, 2025

## Current Market Status
- Bitcoin down **30% from October ATH** ($126,000)
- Down ~5% YTD vs USD
- Down ~40% YTD vs Gold
- Trading at ~$86,775 (as of Dec 24)

## Four Key Risk Factors

### 1. Persistent 'Mechanical' Supply
Long-term "OG" holders began distributing aggressively around the $100,000 psychological level. This strategic, price-insensitive selling weighs on price despite supportive fundamentals.

### 2. Four-Year Cycle Trap
Self-reinforcing belief in Bitcoin's four-year cycle creates front-running behavior among traders. Many traders still act on halving cycle expectations by selling, even as institutional voices argue the cycle narrative should be retired.

### 3. AI Bubble Fears
The AI trade started to wobble in H2 2025. As skepticism grew around valuations and monetization timelines, momentum investors pulled back from risk assets. Bitcoin behaves like a liquidity-sensitive risk asset - when risk appetite fades, crypto fades with it.

### 4. Red October Liquidation Event
October's sharp **$19 billion liquidation event** delivered enduring damage. Liquidity providers and market makers that absorbed forced selling have steadily reduced exposure, creating persistent overhang into year-end.

## 2026 Outlook (Bullish Long-Term)

Despite the decline, analysts remain bullish: "The debt driven, fiat based system requires ever more debt and deficits to survive, requiring ever expanding central bank balance sheets to fund those deficits and provide liquidity to the market via money printing. Literally nothing stops this train."

# BlackRock: Four Factors Behind Bitcoin's Recent Volatility

**Source:** BlackRock Digital Assets (Matt Kunke, Robert Mitchnick)
**Date:** December 9, 2025

## Current Market Context
- Bitcoin fell from ATH of **$126K** (early October) to as low as **$84K** (~33% decline)
- No single discrete catalyst - confluence of loosely connected factors

## Four Key Volatility Factors

### 1. Shift in Fed Outlook
- Expectations for slower Fed rate cuts pushed real yields higher
- October: ~30% chance of one rate cut or fewer
- December: ~46% chance of one rate cut or fewer by March 2026
- Bitcoin shows sensitivity to USD real rates (similar to gold and EM currencies)

### 2. Unwind of Excessive Leverage
- Heavy use of leveraged perpetual futures amplified speculation
- October 10 "flash crash" triggered automated forced liquidations
- Chain effect erased over **30% of futures open interest**
- Lingering aftereffects creating market overhang

### 3. Whales Rebalancing
- Long-time holders (cost basis <$1K) viewed $100K as psychological milestone
- Crossing threshold prompted portfolio rebalancing
- Concentrated exposure reduction adding selling pressure

### 4. Unwind of Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) Optimism
- DAT shares sold off sharply QTD
- Now trade near or below NAV of Bitcoin holdings
- Large premiums that spurred new listings have vanished
- Removing source of buying pressure

## Historical Context

BlackRock notes that since IBIT launch (January 2024), Bitcoin has seen two other ≥25% pullbacks, each followed by recovery and subsequent rally to new highs.

## Path Forward (2026 Outlook)

Key drivers expected to be:
1. **Liquidity conditions** in U.S. and major economies (pace of rate cuts)
2. **Institutional and Wealth Advisory adoption** trajectory (trending upward since Jan 2024)

Long-term fundamental drivers remain intact:
- Institutional adoption
- Regulatory maturation
- Rising global concerns around sovereign debt
- Geopolitical fragmentation

## Portfolio Role
Bitcoin as a fixed supply, non-sovereign, decentralized global asset can provide unique diversification benefits in times of fear and geopolitically disruptive events.
