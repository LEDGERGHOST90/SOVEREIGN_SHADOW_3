# IMF Working Paper: The Crypto Cycle and US Monetary Policy

**Source:** IMF Working Paper WP/23/163, August 2023
**Authors:** Natasha Che, Alexander Copestake, Davide Furceri, Tammaro Terracciano
**Department:** Asia and Pacific Department

## Abstract Key Findings

The IMF researchers identify a **single price component** they label the "crypto factor" that explains **80% of variation in crypto prices**. Their key findings include:

1. **Correlation with Equity Markets:** The crypto factor's increasing correlation with equity markets coincided with the entry of institutional investors into crypto markets.

2. **Fed Tightening Impact:** US Fed tightening reduces the crypto factor through the **risk-taking channel** - in contrast to claims that crypto assets provide a hedge against market risk.

3. **Risk Aversion Model:** A stylized heterogeneous-agent model with time-varying aggregate risk aversion can explain their empirical findings.

4. **Spillover Risk:** The research highlights possible spillovers from crypto to equity markets if the participation of institutional investors ever became large.

## Methodology
- JEL Classification: E44, E52, F33
- Keywords: US Monetary Policy, Cryptoassets, Stock Markets

## Implications for Trading
- Crypto is NOT a hedge against market risk
- Fed policy directly impacts crypto through risk-taking channel
- Institutional adoption increases correlation with traditional markets
- Monetary tightening = bearish for crypto
- Single factor explains 80% of crypto price variation


## Introduction Key Data Points
