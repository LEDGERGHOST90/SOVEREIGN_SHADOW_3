## Key Framework: Four-Year Cycle Analysis

Grayscale Research documents that crypto valuations have historically followed an apparent four-year cycle with successive periods of appreciation and depreciation. Bitcoin prices show statistical momentum - gains tend to follow gains, losses tend to follow losses.

## Historical Cycle Performance

| Cycle | Duration | Return Multiple |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Cycle 1 | ~1 year | >500x |
| Cycle 2 | ~2 years | >500x |
| Cycle 3 (Jan 2015 - Dec 2017) | ~3 years | >100x |
| Cycle 4 (Dec 2018 - Nov 2021) | ~3 years | ~20x |
| Current Cycle (Nov 2022 - present) | ~2+ years | ~6x |

The current cycle's 6x return is significantly less than prior cycles, suggesting potential for further appreciation based on historical patterns.

## Key On-Chain Indicators (as of May 2024)

### MVRV Ratio
- Historical cycle peak threshold: **≥4.0**
- Current level (May 2024): **2.6**
- Interpretation: Intermediate stage, below historical peak levels

### HODL Waves (Free Float Activity)
- Historical cycle peak threshold: **≥60%** of free float transacted in one year
- Current level: **~54%**
- Interpretation: More coins expected to change hands before peak

### MCTC Ratio (Miner Cap to Thermocap)
- Historical cycle peak threshold: **≥10**
- Current level: **~6**
- Interpretation: Intermediate point, not yet at historical peak levels

## Bitcoin Dominance Pattern
- In last two cycles, Bitcoin dominance peaked ~2 years into bull market
- Bitcoin dominance has recently begun to fall (as of May 2024)
- Pattern suggests potential rotation into altcoins in third year of cycle

## Altcoin Market Indicators

### Funding Rates
- Current: Meaningfully positive but below earlier 2024 highs
- Interpretation: Moderate speculative length, not extreme

### Perpetual Futures Open Interest
- Pre-Dec 9 liquidation: Nearly **$54 billion** across top 3 exchanges
- Post-liquidation: Declined by ~$10 billion but remains elevated
- Interpretation: High speculative positioning, warrants monitoring

## Structural Changes This Cycle
- Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs approved in U.S.
- **$36.7 billion** net capital inflows into ETPs (as of Dec 2024)
- Greater regulatory clarity expected
- May cause four-year cycle pattern to reshape or diminish

## Grayscale's Conclusion
"Current mix of indicators consistent with an intermediate stage of the crypto market cycle... As long as supported by fundamentals — like application adoption and broader macro market conditions — we see no reason why the crypto bull market can't continue into 2025 and beyond."
