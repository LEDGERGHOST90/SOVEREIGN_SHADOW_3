URL: https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-50-2025/
Date: December 17, 2025

## Executive Summary Key Points

### Current Market Regime
- Bitcoin remains confined within a **structurally fragile range**
- Recent rejection near **$93k** with gradual drift toward **$85.6k**
- Dense distribution between **$93k-$120k** continues to cap recovery attempts
- Failure to reclaim the **0.75 quantile (~$95k)** and **Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at $101.5k** keeps upside constrained

### Critical Support/Resistance Levels
- **True Market Mean: $81.3k** - Key support level being defended by patient buyers
- **Short-Term Holder Cost Basis: $101.5k** - Must reclaim for bullish momentum
- **Overhead Supply Zone: $93k-$120k** - Dense resistance cluster

### On-Chain Metrics

#### Supply in Loss
- **6.7 million BTC** currently held at a loss (7D-SMA)
- **Highest level of loss-bearing supply observed in this cycle**
- Pattern mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles

#### Loss Distribution
- **23.7%** of circulating supply currently underwater
- **10.2%** held by Long-Term Holders (LTH)
- **13.5%** held by Short-Term Holders (STH)
- Loss-bearing supply from STH gradually maturing into LTH cohort

#### Loss Sellers
- Supply attributed to Loss Sellers has climbed to **~360k BTC**
- Risk: Break below True Market Mean ($81.3k) could expand this cohort further

### Market Structure Comparison
- Current structure closely mirrors **early 2022** transitional phases
- Top-heavy market structure where recovery attempts are capped by overhead sell pressure
- Mounting investor frustration preceding shift toward more pronounced bearish conditions

### Spot Market Analysis
- Spot demand lacks persistence
- Periodic bursts of buy-side activity failing to develop into sustained accumulation
- Coinbase spot CVD relatively constructive (US-based investors)
- Binance and aggregate exchange flows remain choppy and directionless
- Dip-buying remains tactical and short-term in nature

### Corporate Treasury Activity
- Treasury flows remain episodic rather than sustained accumulation trend
- Net flows show sporadic large inflows from small subset of firms
- Corporate demand remains opportunistic rather than systematic
- Not acting as reliable, cycle-wide source of structural demand

### Futures Market
- Open interest trending lower from cycle highs
- Ongoing position reduction rather than fresh leverage deployment
- Funding rates oscillating around neutral levels
- Drawdown NOT driven by excessive long positioning or overcrowded leverage
- Lack of speculative conviction rather than forced deleveraging

### Options Market
- Range-bound regime reinforced
- Front-end volatility compressed post-FOMC
- Downside risk priced but stable
- Flows favor premium harvesting over directional bets
- Large December expiries pinning price action into year-end

## Key Risk Factors
1. Break below True Market Mean ($81.3k) could trigger expanded loss selling
2. Time-driven stress test on underwater supply
3. Weak ETF flows and thin spot liquidity
4. Muted futures positioning
5. Defensive options activity
6. High sensitivity to macro catalysts

## Market Regime Classification
**Current Regime: Range-Bound / Time-Driven Consolidation with Bearish Bias**
- Not in active capitulation phase
- Not in accumulation phase
- Transitional period similar to early 2022

## FTI Consulting: October 2025 Crypto Crash Analysis
Source: https://www.fticonsulting.com/insights/articles/crypto-crash-october-2025-leverage-met-liquidity
Date: December 24, 2025
Author: Volkan Kubali, Ph.D (Managing Director)

### October 10, 2025 Crash - Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Leverage Liquidated | **$19 billion+** in ~1 day |
| BTC Decline from ATH | **~30%** |
| Open Interest Decline | **>40%** from October highs |
| BTC Order Book Depth | Shrank **>90%** on key venues |
| Bid-Ask Spreads | Widened from single-digit bps to **double-digit percentages** |

### Crash Catalyst and Mechanism

The crash was triggered by a 100% China tariff threat hitting global risk assets. Three factors transformed the selloff into a crisis:

1. **Positioning**: Elevated BTC and ETH perpetual futures open interest
2. **Funding**: Rates climbed from ~10% annualized to ~30% by October 6
3. **Infrastructure**: Unified (cross-asset) margin systems created contagion

### Market Microstructure Failures

**Liquidity Collapse:**
- Top-of-book depth shrank >90% on major venues
- Market makers widened spreads dramatically or stepped away
- Executable order size evaporated
- Negative feedback loops exacerbated selling

**Stablecoin De-peg (USDe):**
- USDe traded at **$0.65** on Binance (~35% discount)
- Remained near $1 on other exchanges and DeFi pools
- Venue-specific oracle pricing triggered unnecessary liquidations
- Positions solvent under cross-venue pricing were liquidated

**Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) Events:**
- Best-hedged shorts forcibly closed to maintain exchange solvency
- Hedged portfolios turned into naked positions during stress
- Creates second layer of risk beyond trade economics

### Structural Vulnerabilities Identified
- Crypto venues play multiple roles (exchange, clearinghouse, margin provider)
- Risk concentrated in venue-level margin engines
- High leverage (20-50x) widely available
- Price discovery fragmented across exchanges
- Inconsistent practices between venues

### Post-Crash Market Changes
- Funding rates normalized
- Several venues tightened leverage caps
- Raised haircuts on fragile collateral
- Steps toward multi-venue oracle pricing
- Millions of accounts closed
- Retail inflows to leveraged products cooled

## Historical Precedents and Cycle Analysis

### Q4 2025 Performance - Historical Context
Source: CoinDesk/CoinGlass (December 2025)

Bitcoin's Q4 2025 performance represents the **worst fourth quarter since 2018**, with a decline of approximately **22-24%**. This places 2025 among the weakest year-end periods outside of major bear markets.

| Period | Q4 Performance | Context |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Q4 2018 | -42% | Bear market bottom |
| Q4 2025 | -22.54% to -23.8% | Current cycle |
| Q4 2022 | Negative | Post-FTX collapse |

### Historical Bear Market Corrections
| Cycle | Peak-to-Trough | Duration |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| 2017-2018 | -84% | ~12 months |
| 2021-2022 | -77% | ~12 months |
| 2025 (projected) | -55% (to $56K) | TBD |

The projected 55% drawdown from ATH (~$126K) to $56K realized price would mark the **smallest bear market correction on record** for Bitcoin.

### Halving Cycle Analysis
Historical pattern following halvings (2016, 2020):
- Typically 10-20x rally within 18 months post-halving
- 2024 halving occurred in April 2024
- Current cycle showing divergence from historical pattern
- Some analysts suggest the 4-year halving cycle may be "broken"

### Grayscale Research: State of the Crypto Cycle
Source: https://research.grayscale.com/reports/the-state-of-the-crypto-cycle
Authors: Zach Pandl, Michael Zhao
Last Updated: May 29, 2024

**Key Framework:**
Grayscale identifies that crypto valuations have historically followed an apparent four-year cycle with successive periods of appreciation and depreciation. They recommend monitoring blockchain-based indicators to track cycle position and inform risk management.

**Historical Cycle Performance:**

| Cycle | Duration | Return (from low) |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Cycle 1 | ~1 year | >500x |
| Cycle 2 | ~2 years | >500x |
| Cycle 3 (Jan 2015 - Dec 2017) | ~3 years | >100x |
| Cycle 4 (Dec 2018 - Nov 2021) | ~3 years | ~20x |
| Current (Nov 2022 - present) | 2+ years | ~6x |

**Key Cycle Indicators:**

1. **MVRV Ratio** (Market Value to Realized Value):
   - Historical peak threshold: 4.0
   - Current reading (as of report): 2.6
   - Interpretation: Intermediate stage, room to run

2. **HODL Waves** (coins moved in last year vs free float):
   - Historical peak threshold: 60%+
   - Current reading: ~54%
   - Interpretation: More coins expected to change hands before peak

3. **MCTC Ratio** (Miner Cap to Thermocap):
   - Historical peak threshold: 10
   - Current reading: ~6
   - Interpretation: Intermediate stage

**Grayscale Conclusions:**
- Current mix of indicators consistent with intermediate stage of cycle
- Bull market can potentially extend if supported by fundamentals
- As Bitcoin matures, recurring four-year cycles may reshape or diminish

## Current Market Regime Assessment (December 2025)

Based on the comprehensive research gathered, the current crypto market appears to be in a **transitional regime** with the following characteristics:

### Regime Indicators Summary

| Indicator | Current Value | Historical Peak | Assessment |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| MVRV-Z Ratio | 2.31 | 4.0+ | Intermediate/Cooling |
| Realized Price | $56,000 | N/A | Key support level |
| ETF Flows (Q4) | Net negative | Strong positive | Bearish signal |
| Funding Rates (365d MA) | 2-year low | Elevated | Risk-off positioning |
| BTC from ATH | -30% | N/A | Correction territory |
| Q4 Performance | -22.5% | Varies | Worst since 2018 |

### Regime Classification
**Current State: Early Bear / Late Cycle Correction**

Evidence supporting bear market thesis:
- ETF flows turned negative (vs strong accumulation in Q4 2024)
- Demand growth peaked and reversed since October 2025
- Funding rates at multi-year lows
- Holder behavior patterns similar to late 2021 (pre-2022 bear)
- Q4 2025 worst quarterly performance since 2018

Evidence supporting shallow correction thesis:
- Realized price ($56K) suggests limited downside
- Institutional infrastructure continues building
- Regulatory clarity improving
- On-chain fair value models suggest near fair value at ~$87K
