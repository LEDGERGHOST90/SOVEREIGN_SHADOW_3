## Executive Summary

Tiger Research identifies the crypto industry as joining the mainstream, with institutions becoming key market players. Capital is flowing to projects that generate real revenue, and sustainable business models have become essential.

## 10 Major Market Shifts Predicted for 2026

### 1. Institutional Capital Stays in Bitcoin
Institutional investors are cautious and limiting scope to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market growth will concentrate on assets meeting institutional standards.

### 2. Profitless Projects Face Market Washout
85% of new tokens experience price drops post-TGE (Token Generation Event). Hype-based projects will be replaced at increasing rates. Market shifting toward real revenue and sound fundamentals.

### 3. Utility Failed - Buybacks Are the Answer
Utility-focused tokenomics failed to attract investors. Market demands clear value returns through buybacks and burns. Protocol growth must directly impact token price.

### 4. M&A Opportunities Between Projects to Rise
Web3 maturing with intensifying competition. M&A is fastest path to scale. Winners will drive aggressive M&A activity.

### 5. Robotics and Crypto Create New Gig Economy
Blockchain-based decentralized crowdsourcing for robot training data. New gig economy centered on robotics emerging.

### 6. Media Firms Adopt Prediction Markets
Readers transition from passive consumption to active participation by staking capital on news outcomes.

### 7. TradFi Leads RWA via Own Chains
Traditional financial institutions building own chains for RWA market. Third-party RWA projects without independent asset supply will lose competitive edge.

### 8. ETH Stake ETFs to Boost BTCFi Growth
ETH stake ETF launch will push BTC ETF holders to seek yield. BTCFi fills this gap and will see next wave of growth.

### 9. Fintech to Overtake Exchanges as Main On-Ramp
Fintech apps becoming top choice for crypto trade. New users can buy/sell in apps they already use daily.

### 10. Privacy Tech as Core Institutional Infrastructure
Chain transparency reveals trade plans - weakness for large firms. Privacy tech vital for institutional participation.
