### Open Limit Orders (RWA Thesis)
| Asset | Amount | Price | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| INJ | 9.88 | $4.25 | Open |

## Key Decisions
- Ledger stays COLD - no touching core holdings
- FreqTrade for automated execution going forward
- Barbell strategy: Infrastructure (LINK) + Retail RWA (INJ)
- Ladder entries at support levels, not market buys
- Machine Economy thesis: AI agents will manage tokenized RWAs

## FreqTrade Status
- Version: 2025.11.2
- Exchange: Coinbase Advanced (CDP auth working)
- Strategy: DynamicCrossfire (trend-following, 100/100 Moon Dev score)
- Mode: Dry-run (72-hour validation period)
- Pairs: INJ/USDC, LINK/USDC
- Note: Need mean-reversion strategy for current range-bound market

## Alert System Active
- AI basket scanner: FET, RENDER, SUI with TP1/TP2/TP3 levels
- RWA alerts: LINK (<$22), ONDO (<$0.35), INJ ($3.50-$5 zone, $7 breakout, $10 moon), QNT ($65-75)
- NTFY: sovereignshadow_dc4d2fa1

## Next Steps
1. Monitor limit orders for fills
2. Run FreqTrade dry-run for 72 hours
3. Convert mean-reversion strategy (BandwidthPulse) for current market regime
4. Set take-profit ladder once positions fill
5. Continue monitoring RWA alerts
