# SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The Sovereign Shadow Council is a personified decision framework for trading psychology. Each asset, agent, and platform has a distinct character with personality, voice, and role. Use these characters to generate debates, podcasts, and analysis.

**Core Question Before Any Trade:** "Who's talking right now? The Elder or The Siren?"

# SAMPLE COUNCIL DEBATE

**Scenario:** User wants to buy XRP after a 5% pump

**The Siren:** "See? I told you! It's pumping! Get in now before it's too late!"

**SHADE//AGENT:** "Trade blocked. No stop loss defined. Emotional trigger detected."

**The Ghost:** "You have 0% SOL allocation. Why are you looking at XRP?"
