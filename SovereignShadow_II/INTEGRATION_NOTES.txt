SovereignShadow_II integration notes

- This package is intentionally isolated from legacy modules.
- Exchange connectivity is via CCXT wrappers in `core/exchange_connectors/ccxt_connectors.py`.
- Orchestrator defaults to FAKE data if no API keys are present.
- PerformanceTracker uses SQLite at $SS2_DB_PATH (defaults to /workspace/SovereignShadow_II/state/performance.db).

Environment safety gates (must be set for live orders):
- ENV=production
- ALLOW_LIVE_EXCHANGE=1

Sandbox/FAKE defaults:

- ENV=development
- ALLOW_LIVE_EXCHANGE=0
