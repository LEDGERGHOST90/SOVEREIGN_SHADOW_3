# INTEGRATION NOTES

## Agent 0: System Architect
- Core infrastructure is deployed.
- `Orchestrator` is ready to cycle through regimes and strategies.
- `CoinbaseAdvancedConnector` is implemented with sandbox support.
- `PerformanceTracker` is initialized with SQLite.

## Agent 1: Strategy Modularizer
- Implemented `ElderReversion` and `DynamicCrossfire`.
- Each strategy follows the strict Entry/Exit/Risk module pattern.
- Metadata JSONs are included.

## Agent 9: Backtest Engine
- `BacktestEngine` is functional.
- Supports dynamic loading of strategy modules.
- Calculates Win Rate, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown.
- Verified with integration tests on dummy data.

## Next Steps
1. Agents 2-8 need to implement the remaining 70+ strategies following the `ElderReversion` template.
2. `MarketRegimeDetector` logic should be refined with more robust indicators (ADX, Volatility thresholds).
3. Connectors for other exchanges (OKX, Kraken) need to be implemented inheriting from `BaseExchangeConnector`.
