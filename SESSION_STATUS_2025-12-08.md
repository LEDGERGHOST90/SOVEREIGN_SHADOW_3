# Session Status - December 8, 2025

## What We Fixed This Session

1. **Connected local repo to GitHub** - Your local folder now syncs with `LEDGERGHOST90/SOVEREIGN_SHADOW_3`
2. **Reset local to match GitHub** - Local was out of sync, now matches GitHub's `main`
3. **Added GitHub SSH/auth** - Using `gh` CLI for authentication
4. **Updated BRAIN.json** - Added git status tracking

## Current State

### Git Status: SYNCED
- **Local path:** `/Volumes/LegacySafe/Shadow-3-Legacy-Loop-Platform`
- **GitHub repo:** `github.com/LEDGERGHOST90/SOVEREIGN_SHADOW_3`
- **Current branch:** `main`
- **Current commit:** `2ad79f7` (Merge pull request #2)
- **Backup of old local:** `backup-local-20251208-162934`

### Remotes Configured
| Name | URL | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| origin | https://github.com/LEDGERGHOST90/SOVEREIGN_SHADOW_3.git | Main (GitHub) |
| gitsafe-backup | git://gitsafe:5418/backup.git | Local backup |

## Branches to Review (Not Deleted - Your Call)

### On GitHub:
| Branch | Status | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| `LEDGERGHOST90-SS_III` | MERGED | Can delete |
| `add-claude-github-actions-1765228884546` | MERGED | Can delete |
| `claude/brain-functionality-...` | NOT MERGED | Review or delete |
| `claude/paper-trade-status-update-...` | NOT MERGED | Review or delete |
| `claude/update-github-sovereign-shadow-...` | MERGED | Can delete |

### Delete merged branches (when ready):
```bash
gh api -X DELETE repos/LEDGERGHOST90/SOVEREIGN_SHADOW_3/git/refs/heads/LEDGERGHOST90-SS_III
gh api -X DELETE repos/LEDGERGHOST90/SOVEREIGN_SHADOW_3/git/refs/heads/add-claude-github-actions-1765228884546
gh api -X DELETE repos/LEDGERGHOST90/SOVEREIGN_SHADOW_3/git/refs/heads/claude/update-github-sovereign-shadow-014ZxwouHnwQgt5QSLD61sqs
```

## Folder Organization Suggestion

Your idea: `Shadow3-{LLM}{Build}{current date}{Git Status}`

**My recommendation: Keep it simpler.**

Git already tracks versions, dates, and status. Encoding that in folder names creates confusion and goes stale.

### Suggested Structure:
```
/Volumes/LegacySafe/
├── SovereignShadow3/              # ONE main project folder
│   ├── .git/                      # Git handles versioning
│   ├── BRAIN.json                 # Single source of truth
│   ├── api.py                     # Backend
│   ├── client/                    # Frontend
│   ├── ds_star/                   # DS-STAR modules
│   └── ...
│
├── SS_III/                        # Legacy (can archive or merge into above)
│   └── BRAIN.json                 # Move to SovereignShadow3
│
└── ARCHIVE/                       # Old stuff
    └── Shadow-3-Legacy-Loop-Platform_backup/
```

### Why This Works:
1. **One folder** = one source of truth
2. **Git branches** = different versions/experiments
3. **Git commits** = history with dates
4. **Git tags** = mark releases (`v1.0-dec2025`)
5. **BRAIN.json** = your memory (not folder names)

## Sync Workflow Going Forward

### Daily Flow:
```bash
cd /Volumes/LegacySafe/Shadow-3-Legacy-Loop-Platform

# Pull latest from GitHub (if changed on Replit)
git pull origin main

# Make changes locally with Claude Code
# ...

# Push to GitHub (auto-deploys to Replit)
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

### Where Code Lives:
| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Local Mac** | Development with Claude Code |
| **GitHub** | Central hub, triggers CI/CD |
| **Replit** | Deployed web app |

---

## Active Integrations

- **Claude Code Review** - Runs on PRs (working!)
- **Claude PR Assistant** - Runs on PRs (working!)
- **Replit Auto-Deploy** - Pushes to main trigger deploys

## When You Return

1. Review this document
2. Decide which branches to delete
3. Consider folder consolidation (optional)
4. Continue with DEBT_DESTROYER mission
